"Wed, 17 Dec 2025 18:00:49 +0000",Bitcoin Structure Turns Bearish As Structural Indicators Flip Negative,"Bitcoin is struggling to reclaim the $90,000 level as it continues to test critical demand around the $86,000 zone. After weeks of corrective price action, bulls are finding it increasingly difficult to build a convincing case for trend continuation. Related Reading: XRP Liquidity Dries Up: Futures Buy Volume On Binance Falls from $5.8B to $250M Momentum has faded, upside attempts have been rejected, and market confidence is weakening. As a result, a growing number of analysts are beginning to openly discuss the possibility that Bitcoin is transitioning into a broader bear market phase rather than a temporary pullback within a larger uptrend. This shift in narrative is supported by structural data. In a recent analysis, Axel Adler highlights that Bitcoin’s price action is now aligned with a clear deterioration in market structure. His chart, which combines a composite Structure Shift signal with a Donchian Channel, shows that the indicator has decisively moved into negative territory. The Structure Shift composite ranges from -1 to +1, with values below zero signaling bearish regime dominance. Currently, the signal sits near -0.5, a level historically associated with sustained downside pressure rather than short-lived corrections. At the same time, Bitcoin price has dropped to the lower boundary of the 21-day Donchian Channel and is hovering just above the $85,000 support area. Together, these signals suggest that the market is operating in a risk-off environment, where downside risks remain elevated unless structure improves meaningfully. Bitcoin Structure Confirms Bearish Regime Adler notes that the current position of the Structure Shift composite signal confirms Bitcoin has firmly established itself within a bearish structural zone. With the indicator sitting below zero, the market is no longer in a neutral or transitional phase but operating under sustained downside conditions. According to this framework, the primary trigger for improvement would be a decisive recovery of the composite signal back above the zero threshold, ideally while price continues to hold support within the Donchian Channel. Without that shift, any short-term bounce risks remaining corrective rather than trend-changing. This bearish structure is reinforced by Bitcoin’s Bull-Bear market structure index, which focuses on derivatives dynamics through fast and slow regime components. The latest data shows the bullish component collapsing to just 5%, an extremely low reading that reflects the near absence of constructive long-side momentum. At the same time, the fast bearish component has moved deeper into negative territory, signaling rising seller pressure driven primarily by the futures market. This configuration highlights a critical imbalance. Short-term momentum is firmly controlled by bears, while spot demand has so far proven insufficient to absorb derivatives-led selling pressure. For conditions to improve, the bullish component of the index would need to recover meaningfully, signaling renewed participation from buyers. Taken together, both indicators point to the same conclusion: Bitcoin has undergone a local structural shift into bearish territory. The dominant risk remains continued downside pressure driven by derivatives, especially in the absence of strong spot accumulation. Related Reading: Who Really Sold The Dip? On-Chain Data Exposes Bitcoin’s True Sellers Bitcoin Price Tests Critical Support as Downtrend Persists Bitcoin continues to trade under clear downside pressure. The price now hovers around the $86,500 level after failing to reclaim higher resistance zones. The chart highlights a decisive breakdown below the short- and medium-term moving averages. With BTC trading well beneath the 50-day and 100-day averages. These levels, which previously acted as dynamic support during the uptrend, have now flipped into resistance. Reinforcing the bearish market structure. The most notable technical development is Bitcoin’s interaction with the 200-day moving average, shown in red. Price has briefly tested this long-term support but remains fragile, with follow-through buying notably absent. Historically, sustained trading below faster-moving averages while compressing near the 200-day often signals either a prolonged consolidation phase or the risk of an additional leg lower if demand fails to appear.

"Wed, 17 Dec 2025 17:00:32 +0000",Saylor’s Long Bitcoin Bet Has Left Corporate Rivals Behind: Crypto Entrepreneur,"Michael Saylor’s firm Strategy continues to make Bitcoin headlines with its enormous purchases, making it one of the largest holders in the world. Related Reading: TechCrunch Founder Names XRP Among His Largest Crypto Positions Reports show the company owns 671,268 Bitcoin, roughly 3.2% of the total supply, valued at about $58.61 billion at the time of publication, according to Saylor Tracker. Bitcoin entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano said on his podcast that it would be extremely difficult for any other public company to match Strategy’s buying pace. Massive Holdings And Recent Purchase Strategy announced a fresh buy of 10,645 Bitcoin for $980.3 million, paying an average of $92,098 per coin. That move pushed its total hoard to roughly 3.2% of all Bitcoin in existence. Those are large figures. They also show why rivals would need huge sums to close the gap. Pompliano On The Scale Needed To Compete According to comments made on The Pomp Podcast, Pompliano said that a company trying to match Strategy would have to “raise hundreds of billions of dollars.” He said it would be “very hard to see that happening.” He pointed to Strategy’s early entry in 2020, when Saylor’s initial purchase was about $500 million while Bitcoin traded between $9,000 and $10,000. That initial stake, based on current prices cited in reports, is now worth more than $4.8 billion with Bitcoin trading around $86,950. Market Impact And Buying Method Market watchers have flagged Strategy’s growing share as something to watch. Some worry a single large holder could influence price moves. Others note the firm does most of its buying through over-the-counter desks. OTC trades are used to handle big orders without sending shockwaves through exchange order books. Many investors see the regular, large purchases as a positive sign for Bitcoin demand. Holding Strategy And Influence Concerns Pompliano described 3.2% as “a big number, but it’s also a small number.” He added, “It’s not like they own 10%.” That view captures a split: the holding is large enough to matter for supply dynamics and market psychology, but not so large that it gives absolute control. Still, the combination of size and repeated buys draws attention from traders and regulators alike. Outlook And Long Term Plans Reports quote Strategy’s CEO Phong Lee as saying the company probably won’t sell any Bitcoin until at least 2065. Saylor has also posted that he plans on “buying the top forever.” Those statements reinforce a long-term stance rather than short-term trading. The market tends to treat such commitments as bullish, and many participants adjust expectations for future demand accordingly. Related Reading: Ethereum Meets Wall Street: JPMorgan Rolls Out Tokenized Fund A Dominant Buyer With 671,268 Bitcoin on the books and a steady program of purchases, Strategy remains a dominant public buyer. Based on current numbers and public comments, it will be difficult for another listed company to match that level of accumulation without very large capital raises or a dramatic change in corporate behavior. The pace set by Strategy is likely to keep drawing attention from investors watching supply and demand for Bitcoin. Featured image from Pexels, chart from TradingView",NewsBTC,BTC

While global debate continues over whether crypto can coexist with national currencies, Russian lawmakers are reinforcing a long-held view. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Death Cross’ Panic Returns: History Says It’s A Late Signal Inside the country, payments remain the sole domain of the ruble. The position comes as crypto usage grows worldwide and as Russia experiments with alternative settlement tools for cross-border trade under pressure from sanctions. At the center of the latest comments is Anatoly Aksakov, chair of the State Duma Committee on Financial Markets and a key figure behind Russia’s crypto legislation. Speaking to state media, Aksakov said there is no ambiguity in the law. BTC's price records some gains on the daily chart. Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview Lawmakers Reinforce Ruble-only Payment Rule In Russia, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum can be held or traded as investments, but they are not permitted to function as a means of payment in domestic commerce, according to lawmaker Anatoly Aksakov. All payments for goods and services must continue to be settled in rubles. Aksakov’s remarks restate provisions introduced in Russia’s 2020 digital assets law, which removed cryptocurrencies from any form of legal tender. Lawmakers argue that money must be issued and controlled by the state, and private digital currencies do not meet that standard. Officials say there are no plans to soften this stance. The rule applies across retail, online services, and business contracts, closing the door on crypto payments regardless of adoption trends or market conditions. Central Bank Skepticism Shapes Policy The Bank of Russia continues to play a decisive role in this approach. Governor Elvira Nabiullina has long warned that cryptocurrencies pose risks to financial stability and consumer protection. The central bank has consistently opposed using crypto as a medium of exchange and has previously pushed for broad restrictions on exchanges and transactions. This position has led to years of friction with the Ministry of Finance, which favored regulation and taxation over outright limits. While several legislative proposals emerged from that debate, none altered the core prohibition on crypto payments. Today, policymakers appear to be aligned in preserving the ruble’s monopoly. Cross-Border Use Grows Despite Domestic Ban Although crypto is barred from internal payments, Russian authorities acknowledge its growing role in international trade. Businesses are permitted to use digital assets for cross-border settlements under an experimental legal regime, a workaround that has gained traction amid global financial restrictions. Officials estimate that billions of dollars’ worth of trade has already moved through such channels. Similarly, Russia has legalized cryptocurrency mining and is tightening oversight of the sector, underscoring a split strategy, limited use abroad, and strict control at home.

"Wed, 17 Dec 2025 15:00:37 +0000",Why This Week Could Be Transformational For The XRP Price,"The XRP price structure and recent momentum are pointing toward a potentially transformational shift this week. Although the cryptocurrency has experienced an extended period of downside pressure, technical signals suggest that XRP may be nearing the end of its corrective phase. If key support levels are tested and defended this week, it could redefine XRP’s short-term trend and set the tone for price action heading into the end of the year.  XRP Price Eyes Dip To $1.64, Builds Uptrend Base Crypto market analyst CasiTrades believes that this week could mark a pivotal turning point for XRP’s price action. In a recent X post, she shared a chart showing XRP trading within a well-defined descending structure marked by lower highs and multiple Fibonacci values.  Related Reading: Dogecoin RSI Hits Levels That Have Triggered ATH Rallies Before CasiTrades noted that XRP’s recent price behavior has confirmed her downside scenario, with the cryptocurrency now approaching the final support zone of its current corrective phase. She highlighted that XRP failed to reclaim the $2.0 level as support over the weekend, confirming what she described as “the pink scenario.” For context, XRP suffered an unexpected breakdown below $2 last week and is currently trading at $1.91 after a slight recovery.  According to the analyst, the market is now firmly in subwave Wave 3 to the downside, with momentum and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) pushing to new extremes that typically precede a major uptrend reversal. She stated that the next key level to watch is around $1.73, which could provide short-term relief if buyers step in.  Below this, CasiTrades emphasized that a more critical area sits near $1.64, the macro support aligning with the 0.618 Fibonacci level. She predicts the XRP price could decline further, from $1.91 to $1.64, this week, viewing this area as the most likely final low of the cryptocurrency’s broader corrective move.  In her post, CasiTrades pointed out that XRP may drop to the projected support in Wave 3 without first bouncing to $1.73. If this direct move occurs, she notes that the market may not require a second retest of the zone, as the support could hold on the first touch. The analyst further explained that a move to $1.64 would align closely with Bitcoin potentially crashing to $79,000.  While she acknowledged that BTC still has a lower support near $64,000 if the $79,000 level fails, CasiTrades emphasized that XRP is unlikely to break below the $1.64, even though a nearby support exists around $1.54 at the golden pocket.  XRP To See Major Rebound This Week While CasiTrades predicts that XRP could first decline to the $1.64 support, she expects the cryptocurrency to bounce sharply from this level, potentially opening the door for an explosive move above the $2.41-$3.00 range. She highlighted that this powerful reversal could occur by Friday, December 19, 2025.  Related Reading: Silk Road Bitcoins Are On The Move Again, Is The BTC Price Ready For Another Dump?

"Wed, 17 Dec 2025 13:30:47 +0000",Analyst Who Predicted The Bitcoin Price Top Reveals The Next Buy Level,"Crypto analyst Doctor Profit has revealed the next Bitcoin price level he is looking to accumulate at in anticipation of a relief rally. Despite plans to buy BTC, the analyst indicated that he is still bearish on the flagship crypto in the long term, with a larger decline expected to unfold.  Analyst Reveals The Next Buy Level As Bitcoin Price Eyes Bounce In an X post, Doctor Profit stated that he is buying BTC around $86,000 as he looks to trade a short-term relief bounce. He reiterated that he sees the probability of the Bitcoin price revisiting the $97,000 to $107,000 region before the next major leg lower unfolds. The analyst added that this projected move is a 20% from the current region, which presents a good risk-reward trade with a tight stop loss.  Related Reading: Analyst Shares Full Technical Bitcoin Price Breakdown – Here’s The Target Doctor Profit is known to have predicted the Bitcoin price top when it was trading at around $126,000. The analyst noted that he remains very bearish in the long term, expecting further declines. As such, he plans to play this move to buy BTC with absolute and the highest form of risk management.  The analyst explained that this means he will ensure to place the stop loss at entry once in solid profit, while his short trade from between $115,000 and $125,000 will still be running. Doctor Profit further remarked that this long setup for the Bitcoin price is aimed at a few weeks only, before the bearish price action resumes with lower targets.  BTC Remains “Extremely Unstable And Bearish” Doctor Profit stated that the Bitcoin price remains extremely unstable and bearish for the mid-term, noting that a strong downside continuation can happen at any moment, even before the flagship crypto reaches the projected $97,000 to $107,000 zone. The analyst added that a deeper and faster sell-off is absolutely possible, so those looking to buy now should take extreme caution.  Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Price Still Hit $140,000? What The Global M2 Money Supply Says Doctor Profit reiterated that his short positions remain fully open, as any upside is treated as distribution and liquidity for the next leg down. The analyst noted that the $70,000 region remains the main target. If the Bitcoin price manages to revisit the $97,000 to $107,000 region, he stated that he would fully take profit again on the position and add the profits to his short position.  In the meantime, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has warned that the Bitcoin price needs to hold the $87,000 region or risk dropping to as low as $70,000. BTC is currently on the edge with Japan set to raise its interest rates this week.  At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $86,600, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

"Wed, 17 Dec 2025 12:00:52 +0000","5,606 Bitcoin: Lightning Network Sets Fresh Capacity Record","Lightning Network capacity hit a new high this week as major exchanges put more Bitcoin into off-chain channels, boosting the network’s total liquidity and changing how users move BTC. Related Reading: Ethereum Meets Wall Street: JPMorgan Rolls Out Tokenized Fund Exchange Support Drives Capacity According to reports, the Lightning Network’s public capacity climbed to about 5,606 BTC, with some trackers briefly showing a peak near 5,637 BTC. That is a clear uptick from earlier levels and marks the highest recorded total so far. Exchanges including Binance and OKX have been named as contributors that added Bitcoin to Lightning channels, and other platforms such as Kraken and Bitfinex are expanding their support as well. These deposits are aimed at speeding up deposits and withdrawals and cutting fees for customers. Network Activity Vs. Public Nodes Based on reports, that increase in capacity has not been matched by a big rise in the number of public nodes or channels. Public node counts sit near 14,940, while public channels are roughly 48,678. In other words, more Bitcoin is available inside the network, but the number of hands handling traffic has not jumped in the same way. Some of this extra liquidity is concentrated in larger, custodial channels run by exchanges, which can move big sums without creating many new public routes. That makes on-chain metrics a bit harder to read. Transaction counts and on-chain fee savings do show real user benefits, even when the node graph looks stable. A separate figure that shows real usage is the share of exchange traffic routed over Lightning. Based on reports, one exchange has routed around 15% of its Bitcoin transactions via Lightning rails after adopting Lightning integrations, pointing to meaningful operational changes at major platforms. New Use Cases And Funding Funding and protocol work are following capacity growth. Tether led a round that raised about $8 million for a startup focused on payments over Lightning, indicating interest in stablecoin flows on the network.

Upgrade today! — Lightning Labs⚡️🌐 (@lightning) December 16, 2025 Protocol upgrades — including work around Taproot-related asset handling and reliability improvements — are also being rolled out to support more varied payments and token types.

Related Reading: TechCrunch Founder Names XRP Among His Largest Crypto Positions Market watchers say this mix of exchange liquidity, developer upgrades, and rising on-platform usage could make Lightning a more practical rail for everyday BTC movement.

Others note that improved user experience, lower costs, and faster finality are what ordinary users will notice first. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",NewsBTC,BTC
"Wed, 17 Dec 2025 11:00:02 +0000",Bitcoin ‘Death Cross’ Panic Returns: History Says It’s A Late Signal,"Bitcoin’s “death cross” is back in the group chat. And yes, the emails too. Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, said he’s been “getting questions from clients” about the latest death cross print — the 50-day moving average slipping under the 200-day — and answered with the kind of data dump that tends to calm people down. “Lagging indicator,” Sigel wrote on X, alongside a table of every Bitcoin death cross going back to 2011. The summary stats are clean: the 6-month median return after a death cross is +30%, the 12-month median is +89%, and the “positive hit rate” is 64%. Another Bitcoin Death Cross, Another Missed Bottom? But the interesting bit isn’t just the returns. It’s Sigel’s market regime column — basically a hint that the same technical signal can mean wildly different things depending on where you are in the cycle. Take the ones tagged as some version of “bottom.” In 2011 (“post-bubble bottom”), the death cross showed up around the wreckage of an early-cycle blow-off, and the next 12 months were +357%. In 2015 (“cycle bottom”), it was +82% at six months and +159% at 12 months — classic post-capitulation behavior where trend indicators catch up late, after price has already stabilized and started to turn. Related Reading: US Bitcoin Session Leads December Returns After Weak November 2020 (“Covid bottom”) is the extreme example: forced liquidation, policy response, then a monster rebound (+812% over 12 months). And 2023 is also tagged “cycle bottom,” with +173% at six months and +121% at 12 months — the kind of “this is awful until it isn’t” regime crypto does better than any asset class. Now look at “structural bear.” That label shows up in 2014 (twice), 2018, and 2022 — and the forward returns are mostly ugly: 2014 prints -48% and -56% over 12 months, 2018 is -35%, and 2022 is -52%. Different environment. Less “washout and bounce,” more “trend is down because the system is deleveraging,” whether that’s miners, credit, exchanges, or macro liquidity tightening. In those regimes, a death cross isn’t a late alarm — it’s the moving averages confirming that the downtrend is real and persistent. Related Reading: Bitcoin Under Pressure As Yen Carry Trade Unwind Hits Global Markets The in-between tags matter too. 2019 is marked “late bear,” with +9% at six months and +89% at 12 — choppy, uneven, but improving as the cycle turns. 2021 is “late cycle”: +30% at six months, then -43% at 12, which fits a regime where trend signals can whipsaw while distribution and macro tightening creep in. And then there’s 2024: “post-ETF regime,” with +58% at six months and +94% at 12. That tag is doing a lot of work. It suggests the backdrop isn’t just “price vs. moving averages,” but structural demand (ETFs), different liquidity plumbing, and a market that may behave less like pure reflexive leverage and more like a hybrid of trad-fi flows plus crypto-native positioning. So the takeaway isn’t “death crosses are bullish.” That’s not true. It’s that the signal is mostly a trailing mirror — and the regime you’re actually in (bottoming, late bear, structural deleveraging, late cycle, post-ETF flow market) is what decides whether it’s a fake-out, a confirmation, or just noise with a scary name.

"Wed, 17 Dec 2025 09:30:48 +0000","The Bearish Structure That Puts Bitcoin Price At $92,550, And Then $82,000","Struggling under the weight of notable selling pressure, the Bitcoin price has since lost its hold on the $90,000 support, leading to a sustained downtrend through the middle of December. Despite calls for a bottom, the cryptocurrency does not seem to be heading in that direction, and some analysts have shared reasons as to why this is the case. Crypt analyst Lingrid maps out the trajectory of the Bitcoin price, showing a bullish short-term, but ultimately ending with more declines. Why The Bitcoin Price Could Crash Further Lingrid’s analysis focuses on Bitcoin’s recent price performance, having hit resistance multiple times above the $92,000 level. This comes as the digital asset is “capped below channel border,” something that is inherently bearish for the price, given the recent price action. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts How Low The XRP Price Will Go Before Bouncing The rejections between $92,500 and $93,500, according to the analyst, show that the Bitcoin price is likely to place in lower highs. Thus, even in the event of a recovery trend, this level still remains a significant roadblock to any rally. Furthermore, the crypto analyst adds that the recent slowdown in the Bitcoin price action has pushed it into a tight compression. With the price still sitting above the rising support line while this happens, Lingrid believes that this shows Bitcoin is entering into a state of equilibrium, and not strength. Usually, this means that the Bitcoin price could be headed for “directional expansion.” Presently, all eyes are on the bears and sellers as the Bitcoin price struggles to hold support. There is still the possibility that the price will rise to $92,500 before facing a rejection. In this scenario, it would trigger further decline toward $82,000 to put in lower lows. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Price Still Hit $140,000? What The Global M2 Money Supply Says There is also the possibility that the digital asset does escape this bearish scenario, but the buyers would have to step back in the ring. Mainly, the Bitcoin price must break out and then hold above the channel, sustaining a move above $92,500. If this plays out, then Lingrid believes that the bearish thesis could be invalidated. Such a case would mean that the Bitcoin focus shifts back toward $100,000. However, with the price currently trending below $90,000 and sentiment being mostly negative, the chances of an invalidation remain slim.

Top Chainlink Addresses Have Been Adding Since The Start Of November In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Santiment has discussed about the latest trend in the holdings of the top Chainlink addresses. Santiment defines &#8220;top addresses&#8221; as the 100 largest wallets on the network. Related Reading: Bitcoin, Ethereum Plunge Triggers Near-$600 Million Crypto Long Flush This category would naturally include the largest of whales on the blockchain, who carry some degree of influence due to the sheer size of their holdings. As such, the behavior of these investors may be worth monitoring. Now, here is the chart shared by Santiment that shows how the Chainlink supply held by the top addresses has changed over the last few months: The value of the metric appears to have gone up in recent weeks &#124; Source: Santiment on X As displayed in the above graph, the combined supply of the 100 largest Chainlink wallets witnessed a decline in October, implying that these massive entities were participating in distribution. The selling from the top addresses first began as LINK&#8217;s price went through a sharp crash. The selloff continued until the start of November, when the indicator finally arrived at a bottom. Shortly after, the supply of the 100 largest LINK investors saw a reversal, signaling the return of accumulation. According to Santiment, these whales have collectively added 20.46 million tokens (about $263 million) to their holdings. This has not only retraced the October drawdown in their supply, but also in fact taken it to an even higher level. While the top Chainlink addresses have shown net accumulation since the start of November, the pace of buying hasn&#8217;t been constant. From the chart, it&#8217;s apparent that most of the accumulation occurred in November, with not much coming in December so far. It now remains to be seen what trend the 100 largest LINK investors will show next, and whether it will have any influence on where the cryptocurrency heads next. In some other news, Chainlink recently lost a multi-year technical support line, as analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted in an X post. As is visible in the above chart, Chainlink made two retests of this line during the first half of 2025 and each time, it found support. The retest that occurred after the latest price downtrend, however, ended up in failure, with the asset dropping below this line for the first time since 2023.

"Wed, 17 Dec 2025 07:00:58 +0000","XRP Price Must Defend This Level To Avoid 50% Breakdown, Analyst Warns","As the crypto market recovers from the latest pullback, XRP is attempting to climb up from its recent lows. Some analysts have suggested that the cryptocurrency must defend its current levels or risk a 50% drop to levels not seen since 2024. Related Reading: Solana Leads As Most Popular Blockchain Ecosystem For Second Consecutive Year – Report XRP At Make-Or-Break Level Amid the start-of-week market correction, XRP recorded a 6% drop toward its lowest level in weeks. The price lost $2.00 support on Monday morning and continued to lose key levels despite uninterrupted institutional interest. The cryptocurrency has been trading within the $2.00-$2.25 price range over the past month, only losing its lower boundary during the late November pullback. Monday’s correction sent the altcoin below the range’s lower support again, hitting a multi-week low of $1.88 before bouncing around an area that has been crucial for the past year. Notably, XRP has bounced from the $1.85-$1.90 support zone after every major correction since the November 2024 breakout, climbing back above the $2.00 level each time. However, some market observers have suggested that the price risks a significant correction if it is unable to hold the current levels. Ali Martinez pointed out that the cryptocurrency has fallen below its one-year price range, between the $1.92-$3.27 levels, which could lead to a 50% drop below this area. To the analyst, XRP’s price must secure a daily close above $1.92 to prevent a drop to the $1.00 support, which has not been seen in over a year. Similarly, Cheds Trading affirmed that XRP is “flirting with a high time frame breakdown.” Per the chart, the altcoin appears to be forming a high-timeframe rounding top or double top pattern with a higher high. The analyst noted that in the case of the latter, the M formation would be confirmed if the $1.88 level, where the pattern’s neckline is situated, is lost. This could lead to a “measured move to roughly [the] MA 200 area/$1.00 range.” Price Ready For 2026 Markup Phase? Despite the warnings, other market watchers shared a positive outlook for XRP in the coming months. Trader Niels affirmed that the leading altcoin is “looking good” at the current levels. According to the post, the cryptocurrency is “sweeping the $1.8 support zone again” while showing a bullish divergence on the daily timeframe, which suggests that the price could soon move to higher levels. To the trader, once XRP breaks above $2.20 resistance, it could surge 27%-37% towards the $2.80-$3.00 area “within a month.” Meanwhile, analyst ChartNerd highlighted that XRP appears to be repeating its 2023-2024 price action, which led to its massive breakout in November 2024. The chart shows that the altcoin accumulated for a year and a half, bouncing between the range’s lower and upper boundaries before its markup phase in late Q4 2024. Related Reading: XRP Hasn’t Entered A Bear Market Yet; Analyst Shares Why Following this expansion period, the cryptocurrency is showing a similar accumulation range, leading the analyst to suggest that XRP may continue consolidating within its current range before another markup phase occurs. “Regardless of scenarios, or how ugly/beautiful it gets, a massive markup phase similar to November 2024 is likely between now and late 2026,” he stated. As of this writing, XRP is trading at $1.92, a 1.65% increase in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",NewsBTC,BTC

"Wed, 17 Dec 2025 18:00:00 +0000",IO Interactive's 007 First Light reimagines James Bond as a young and reckless spy,"<p>The creators of the Hitman series have honed their style of- open-ended and spectacle-driven sandboxes across several games, and now they're taking their signature immersive gameplay to the world of James Bond. With 0<em>07 First Light</em>, developer IO Interactive is crafting an origin story for the globetrotting British spy, showing how he undertook daring missions at the start of his career to eventually become the world's most infamous agent.</p><p>Before the reveal at The Game Awards of <em>007 First Light</em>'s newest villain, <a class=""link"" href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igTh9ud5Liw"" target=""_blank"">played by Lenny Kravitz</a>, we had an early look at the latest bits of plot for James Bond's origin story as a superspy. We also spoke with cinematic and narrative director Martin Emborg about the main inspirations for the game, how Bond's origin taps into decades of lore, and why a good spy story is timeless.</p><p>&quot;What I think is kind of baked into doing an origin story for a character like James Bond, is that everyone knows the character and who he's going to become,&quot; Emborg said. &quot;But how does he become this character? I think that's an exciting challenge from a storytelling perspective.&quot;</p><figure><img alt="" "" src=""https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/007FirstLight_Screenshots_2.jpg"" style=""height: 1440px; width: 2560px;"" /><figcaption>IO Interactive's James Bond is young and inexperienced.</figcaption><div class=""photo-credit"">IO Interactive</div></figure><p>While some Bond films and novels have touched upon the early years of the iconic character, <em>007 First Light</em> will be the first attempt at an actual, modernized origin story. As a twenty-something new MI6 recruit, this James Bond, portrayed by Patrick Gibson, is inexperienced and brash, which can result in some operations going off the rails. He still possesses a certain cunning, and near-supernatural levels of charisma and resourcefulness. This presents a solid archetype for the game’s open-ended missions where players will explore tightly designed worlds with a multitude of tasks and objectives to handle – however the players see fit.</p><p>While IO Interactive's Hitman series taps into the spy experience, what really separates James Bond from Agent 47 is that he's a far more social character. The social element will play a big part in how players can find ways to distract, or even outright bluff through charisma to sneak into areas.. Emborg explained that James Bond's resourcefulness also makes him a compelling character for a video game, especially one that is all about player agency.</p><figure><img alt="" "" src=""https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/007FirstLight_Screenshots_4.jpg"" style=""height: 1440px; width: 2560px;"" /><figcaption>007 First Light will take players to several locations, including Slovakia and what appears to be Vietnam.</figcaption><div class=""photo-credit"">IO Interactive</div></figure><p>&quot;Bond is a competent character,” Emborg said. “We want to give the player the opportunities to have that agency to say, 'Oh, I'm gonna talk to that guy,' or, 'I'm gonna go and punch that guy,’ or, ‘I can probably crawl up into a tight space to sneak in.' Having that sense of agency is pivotal if you want to deliver a full Bond experience. Obviously, the social aspect of that is important; to embed yourself and infiltrate socially is a big part of that Bond experience.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Emborg said the rhythm of a James Bond game is different from a Hitman title, even though espionage, infiltration and subterfuge are at the core of both.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;We have a lot of experience with that from obviously making Hitman, but there are just many more gears to Bond,” he said. “Of course, the shape of this game is different. We have sandbox locations where you make the open-ended decisions, but we also have other levels where it is a chase or a set-piece encounter, and then it opens up again. So we kind of coined the term, <em>having a game that breathes</em>. It's a very different way of playing this type of game that we usually do, so we've definitely bolstered our toolbox for this game.&quot;</p><p>In many ways, <em>007 First Light</em> is a story that can only be told in an interactive format. The new game will pull from numerous novels and films for its plot, and it also features a large cast of familiar characters seen throughout the franchise – such as MI6 assistant Moneypenny (performed by Kiera Lester), gadget guru and quartermaster Q (played by Alastair Mackenzie), and team leader M (Priyanga Burford).&nbsp;</p><div><div style=""width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;""></div></div><p>But like any singular Bond story, <em>First Light</em> features its own set of original characters. In addition to James Bond's MI6 mentor John Greenway (portrayed by Lennie James), a new core villain, black-market smuggler and warlord Bawma, will be played by Lenny Kravitz. It's a familiar setup for a Bond experience for sure, but within the context of a video game – one made by IO Interactive – it really taps looks to tap into the Bond fantasy more than other games have.&nbsp;</p><p>From the gameplay demos and trailers we've seen, IO Interactive looks to be channeling the style and lore from decades of Bond with its modernized reboot of the character. From deep cuts to <em>On Her Majesty's Secret Service</em> – one of the great and underrated Bond movies – and <em>You Only Live Twice</em>, <em>007 First Light</em> is keeping a keen eye on paying tribute to what came before.</p><p>&quot;At the very beginning, it was very much like a maelstrom of [ideas], then suddenly something emerges, and you build up a story around it,&quot; Emborg said. He continued, “I love doing this stuff and with great reverence for the material. It's a privilege to work in this universe. James Bond is one of the few IPs that still hasn't been overdone, in my view. We have a space to come in with a fresh take, and he's a character who's seen a lot of versions over the years.&quot;</p><figure><img alt="" "" src=""https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/007FirstLight_Screenshots_1.jpg"" style=""height: 1440px; width: 2560px;"" /><figcaption>Confirmed MI6 gadgets include the &quot;Q-Watch.&quot;</figcaption><div class=""photo-credit"">IO Interactive</div></figure><p>So far, <em>007 First Light</em> has the makings of not only the biggest Bond game but also the most true-to-life simulation of being a superspy. While previous Bond games like <em>Goldeneye </em>and <em>Everything or Nothing</em> are well-loved classics, they embody traditional video game shooting spectacle. <em>007 First Light</em> is looking to lean into the immersive element of the Hitman games in its adaptation of James Bond, finally giving players the opportunities to explore the social aspects of spy work on a grand scale.&nbsp;</p><p><em>007 First Light</em> will arrive on March 27, 2026, for PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p><p><br /></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/io-interactives-007-first-light-reimagines-james-bond-as-a-young-and-reckless-spy-180000758.html?src=rss",Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics,TECH

Initially we found the experience of using the app to be needlessly complicated compared to some of its rivals, but get over that hurdle and it’s impressively fully-featured. There are plenty of customization options, a helpful “goals” feature and a thorough month-in-review recap that beats out similar features from some of its competitors. We also like how you can grant account access to others.</p> <span id=""end-legacy-contents""></span>
<p>Besides the steep learning curve, we also noted that the mobile app is less intuitive to use than the web version, which might pose a problem if you were hoping to do most of your accounting on the go. We also had some issues with the app failing to distinguish between bills and other recurring expenses, as well as a few bugs along the way.</p>

Off the top, this will be a shorter review because most of what I said about the <a class=""link"" href=""https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/oneplus-15-review-a-great-phone-if-photography-isnt-a-priority-143000489.html"" target=""_blank"">OnePlus 15</a> also applies to the OP15R.

<p>Like the OnePlus 15, the 15R looks like the OnePlus 13s and 13T, a pair of smaller, 6.32-inch phones the company released in India and China this past spring. I said the design of the OP15 was boring and derivative of the <a class=""link"" href=""https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-16-pro-and-pro-max-review-apple-focuses-on-cameras-and-customization-120052459.html"" target=""_blank"">iPhone 16 Pro</a>. The 15R has done nothing to change that opinion. With one fewer camera, the OP15R doesn't look much different from the iPhone 12 I've been hanging on to since 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, I'm more fond of the 15R's mint breeze color (the phone is also available in charcoal black) than the sand storm shade of my OP15. We're big fans of minty phones here at Engadget, and OnePlus has gone with a particularly pleasing hue of the color with its new phone. With the redesign, OnePlus has also improved the phone's waterproofing, bringing it in line with the OP15. The new handset is IP69K-certified against moisture and dust, meaning it can withstand heated water shot at it at pressure. Like the OP15, the 15R trades OnePlus' old Alert Slider for a new Plus Key. It functions like the iPhone's Action button, allowing you to add a shortcut for a favorite feature. For example, you can configure it to open the camera app or act as a do not disturb toggle, among a few other options.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One departure from the OP15 is that the 15R has a larger 6.83-inch display, making it slightly taller than its sibling. OnePlus is marketing this as one reason buyers might pick the 15R over the OP15, but holding the phones side by side, there's not much difference between the two. They're both big, and you'll either like that or won't.</p>
<p>On top of being big, the 15R's screen can refresh at a fast 165Hz in games. The two displays are also comparable in terms of resolution and brightness; both can push 1,800 nits of brightness. One difference I noticed is the OnePlus 15 has a warmer panel, even when the two phones are set to the same colorspace. I've reached out to OnePlus to find what might be causing the disparity, but for now it may be due to a quality control issue or oversight in the company's software.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One last thing, OnePlus has upgraded the 15R to add an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor beneath the screen. This is placed in a nice spot toward the bottom third of the display, and it's fast and accurate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The OnePlus 15R is the first phone in North America to arrive with Qualcomm's latest <a class=""link"" href=""https://www.engadget.com/ai/the-snapdragon-8-gen-5-is-a-cut-down-version-of-qualcomms-flagship-elite-chipset-063050786.html"" target=""_blank"">Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 chipset</a>. Not to be confused with the Snapdragon Gen 5 Elite in the OP15, this new chipset is similar to Qualcomm's flagship system-on-a-chip but has a weaker CPU and GPU. This is reflected in benchmarks like Geekbench 6 where the OP15 handily outperforms the OP15R. It's not even close, either, with the OP15 delivering standout single- and multi-core scores of 3,773 and 11,293, while the 15R put up more modest results of 2,857 and 9,512.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From that perspective, you're losing a fair amount of performance, but real-world use tells a different story. Outside of the handful of games such as <em>Call of Duty: Mobile and PUBG</em> that support the OP15 and 15R's 165Hz displays, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 offers more than enough muscle for the majority of applications.&nbsp;Even for most games (like the ones I like to play, including <em>Diablo Immortal</em> and <em>League of Legends: Wild Rift</em>), the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 is a great match.&nbsp;</p>
<p>OnePlus also hasn't skimped on the 15R's other internal components. You're still getting 12GB of LPDDR5X Ultra RAM and 256GB of UFS 4.1 storage. That's the same configuration as the base model of the OP15. This translates to a phone that doesn't miss a beat when switching between apps and loading files like images and videos.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 15R has a slightly bigger battery, coming in at 7,400mAh, up from 7,300mAh on the OP15. In practice, the two phones offer the same amount of battery life. Putting them through both Engadget's video rundown test, they both ran for 38 hours before their batteries died (which makes sense given the OP15R has a bigger screen). Like the OP15, the 15R comes with the OnePlus 55W SUPERVOOC charger in the box. The adapter can get the 15R from dead to 100 percent in less than an hour. If you hate charging your phone, the 15R makes that process as painless as possible, with a battery that both lasts long and won't be at the outlet for hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>By this point you're probably wondering what OnePlus cut from the OP15 to make the 15R more affordable. The answer — quite literally — is an entire camera. The new phone is missing a telephoto camera, something you could find on its predecessor, the OnePlus 13R. And as far as I can tell, the two remaining cameras use the same 50-megapixel and 8MP sensors OnePlus shipped on last year's model. The company also hasn't upgraded the glass on either camera. That leaves the selfie camera as the only area to see some change in the form of a sharper 32MP sensor and the addition of autofocus.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, none of the 15R's cameras stand out. As a whole, they suffer from the same set of problems that plague the OnePlus 15's cameras. They're fine out on a sunny day, but as soon as the light becomes a bit challenging, the 15R struggles with shadow details, resulting in muddy pictures. The more I've used both the OP15 and 15R, the more I've come to the conclusion that OnePlus needs to go back to the drawing board with its new Detail Max Engine. It feels like it's holding back what should, at least on paper, be solid hardware.</p>

OnePlus has also promised to support the 15R for the same amount of time as the OP15: four years with software updates and six years with security patches. That's a shorter window than Google and Samsung, both of which promise seven years on all their latest phones. It's hopefully something that OnePlus decides to change starting with the OnePlus 16. The reason I bring that up is that the company’s version of Android is one I like a lot. OxygenOS is slick, with animations that highlight the speed of the 15R's processor and display. The fact the phone comes with the latest version of OxygenOS means you also get access to all of the company's newest AI features, including its Mind Space hub where you can save screenshots and notes for an on-device model to transcribe and summarize.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In short, the OnePlus 15R is the phone for people who don't care about photos and videos. That's the same conclusion I came to with the OP15. If you're a OnePlus fan, the 15R excels in all the areas you would expect the company's devices to make a good showing: performance, battery life and display responsiveness. Given I wasn't too impressed with the OP15's camera, I would actually recommend the 15R over that model. For $200 off the starting price of the OP15, you're getting a device that has almost all of the same strengths of its more expensive sibling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

While keeping your IP address invisible, you can use your VPN to explore streaming content from all over the world or (virtually) sneak into a sports event that's not available in your area.</p><p>However, while VPNs are widely available, there's a strange dearth of information on what they actually do behind the scenes. You may know that a VPN masks your device with a proxy server to make it look like you're somewhere else, and maybe even that encryption is involved. But finding any more details can mean running a gauntlet of misinformation.</p><p>That's a shame, because the inner workings of a VPN aren't all that difficult to understand. You may not be able to build one yourself without a degree in computer science, but with a little work, you can understand exactly what it's doing on your computer. That's information you can use to select the right VPN for you, and make the most of it once you've got it.</p><h2 id=""70cde443-d9f2-456a-93b4-59c0b8e7b82a""><strong>What is a VPN?</strong></h2><p>To make sure nobody gets left behind, I'll start from the beginning. A VPN (virtual private network) is a method of securely accessing a network, either a closed network (like you might have at the office) or the internet as a whole. Initially, organizations set up VPNs so remote workers can work with secure files. While this still happens, the last 15 years have seen VPNs increasingly marketed to individuals, with <a class=""link"" href=""https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html"" target=""_blank"">Proton VPN</a>, <a class=""link"" href=""https://www.engadget.com/vpn-review-expressvpn-2023-gaming-streaming-160052492.html"" target=""_blank"">ExpressVPN</a> and others seeing massive user growth.</p><p>Broadly, a VPN consists of two parts: the server, which forwards requests to your chosen destination, and the client, a piece of software that lets you interact with the server. <a class=""link"" href=""https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/what-is-a-vpn-and-what-can-you-do-with-one-161549146.html"" target=""_blank"">You can find a longer explanation here</a>, but I'll use the two sections below to tell you what you need to know right now.</p><p>One more note before that — there are multiple kinds of VPNs, including the remote-access VPNs and site-to-site VPNs commonly used by workplaces. However, for this article, I'll be talking mainly about the commercial VPN services sold to individuals for general security needs. Instead of a specific network, these VPNs are designed to handle all of a user's traffic to any point on the internet.</p><h2 id=""5cc696a3-0830-4398-b2ce-ff2c298dab84""><strong>What happens when you use a VPN?</strong></h2><p>First, you use the client to connect to a server — either the fastest one available or a particular location you need. Once you've connected, every request you send to the internet goes through the VPN server first. This communication between your device and the web is encrypted so it can't be traced back to you.</p><p>The VPN server decrypts your requests and sends them on. The destination then communicates with the VPN server, which relays the information back to you — after re-encrypting it so nobody follows it home.</p><p>Since the VPN does everything on your behalf, it's your &quot;mask&quot; online. Your internet service provider (ISP) and third parties can see what's being done, but — so long as you’re not otherwise logged in or identifying yourself — nobody knows that it's you doing it. It's like having a friend order pizza for you so the pizzeria doesn't hear you calling for the third time this week (not that I speak from experience).</p><h2 id=""3fc61835-654b-42ae-b891-e1a638f125af""><strong>What's the point of using a VPN?</strong></h2><p>Why add an extra step to the already complex process of getting online? The two biggest reasons are maintaining anonymity and changing your virtual location. I've already explained how a VPN keeps you anonymous. Among other things, this prevents your ISP from selling your browsing history to advertisers and protects activists who face government repercussions for what they do online.</p><p>Changing your virtual location is part of masking, but it can also be used to see the internet as it's visible in other countries. Streaming services are frequently limited to certain places, and almost all of them change the available content based on their licenses in each nation. You can also use a VPN in a country with a nationwide firewall, <a class=""link"" href=""https://www.engadget.com/2016-04-05-fan-bingxi-great-firewall-of-china.html"" target=""_blank"">like China</a>, to see forbidden outside information sources.</p><h2 id=""6e0d3680-d238-4f09-9c70-12192098a2bf""><strong>How does a VPN work? The full technical explanation</strong></h2><p>Most online explanations stop after defining a VPN as an anonymous agent between you and the internet — but I wrote this article to go a little bit deeper. To understand what a VPN is doing on a technical level, we'll need to cover how the internet works, how the VPN knows where to send encrypted information and just what &quot;encryption&quot; actually is.</p><h3 id=""02caaf09-a724-4593-b963-d8b790c505c1""><strong>How the internet transmits data</strong></h3><p>When you're not using a VPN, internet traffic goes directly from your modem to your ISP, then on to your chosen destination. The key technologies here are IP, which stands for Internet Protocol, and TCP, which stands for Transmission Control Protocol. They're usually combined as TCP/IP.</p><p>You may have heard that every online device has an IP address that identifies it to every other device. TCP/IP governs not just those names but how data moves between them. Here's how it works, step-by-step.</p><ol><li><p>You click a link or enter a URL into your web browser.</p></li><li><p>Your computer sends a request to your modem, asking to see the page associated with the URL. Your modem forwards the request to your ISP.</p></li><li><p>Your ISP finds a domain name server (DNS) that tells it which IP address is connected to the URL you asked to see. It then sends the request to that IP address along the fastest available route, which will involve being relayed between several nodes.</p></li><li><p>That IP address is connected with a server that holds the content you're looking for. Once it receives the request, it breaks the data down into small packets of about 1 to 1.5 kilobytes.</p></li><li><p>These packets separate to find their own fastest routes back to your ISP, your modem and finally your web browser, which reassembles them.</p></li><li><p>You see a web page, likely no more than a second after you asked for it.</p></li></ol><p>The outgoing requests and inbound packets are key to understanding VPN function. A VPN intervenes during step 2 (when your modem contacts your ISP) and step 5 (when your ISP sends the packets back to you). In the next section, I'll explain exactly what it does during those steps.</p><h3 id=""4bfdc75a-e03c-4367-9846-9aa3f1bf8c98""><strong>How VPN tunneling protects data</strong></h3><p>You might have heard a VPN's activities described as &quot;tunneling.&quot; That term refers to a figurative tunnel being created between your device and the VPN. Data enters the tunnel when it's encrypted by the VPN client and exits when it's decrypted by the VPN server. Between those two points, encryption means nobody can see the true data. It's as though it's traveling through an opaque tunnel.</p><p>While the tunnel is a useful metaphor, it may be better to think of VPN encryption as an encapsulation. Each packet of data sent via VPN is &quot;wrapped&quot; in a second packet, which both encrypts the original packet and contains information for reaching the VPN server. However, none of these outer layers have the complete path — each just knows enough to reach the next relay. In this way, the origin point (that's you) remains invisible.</p><p>The same thing happens when the internet returns content to show you. Your ISP sends the data to the VPN server, because, as far as it knows, that's where the request came from. The VPN then encrypts each packet and sends them back to you for decryption and reassembly. It takes a little longer with the extra steps; that's why VPNs always slightly slow down your browsing speed, though the best ones don't do that by much (<a class=""link"" href=""https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/surfshark-vpn-review-a-fast-vpn-for-casual-users-170022675.html"" target=""_blank"">Surfshark</a> is currently the fastest).</p><p>You learned in that last section that two protocols, IP and TCP (usually combined as TCP/IP), are responsible for letting online devices talk to each other, even if they've never connected before. In the same way, a VPN protocol is like a shared language that lets VPNs encrypt, move and decrypt information. See the next section to learn how a VPN protocol works in detail.</p><h3 id=""795a93d9-5500-4c8a-b5a1-fcfde25c4ccd""><strong>How VPN protocols encrypt data</strong></h3><p>VPN protocols are the technology behind VPNs; every other feature of your VPN is just a method of interacting with them. All protocols are designed to encrypt data packets and wrap them in a second layer that includes information on where to send them. The main differences are the shape of that second layer, the types of encryption used and how the client establishes its initial secure connection with the server.</p><p>It's extremely common for VPNs to advertise protocols with &quot;bank-grade&quot; or &quot;military-grade&quot; encryption. This is talking about the 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256), a symmetric encryption algorithm, which is used by financial institutions and the US government and military. AES-256 is indeed some of the strongest available encryption, but it's only part of the story. As a symmetric algorithm, it's not fully secure on its own, because the same keys are used to encrypt and decrypt it — and those keys can be stolen.</p><p>For that reason, most VPN protocols use AES-256 (or a similarly strong cipher like ChaCha20) to encrypt the data packets themselves, then combine it with a larger suite of multiple encryption algorithms. One of the most reliable and popular protocols, OpenVPN, uses the asymmetric TLS protocol to establish a secure relationship between client and server, then transmits packets encrypted with AES-256 across that channel, knowing the keys will be safe.</p><p>Explaining this could easily reach the length of a book, but the basic principle isn't complicated. In asymmetric encryption, a sender encodes data with a unique key, then a recipient decodes it with a different paired key. The keys are provided by a trusted third party. In a maneuver called a TLS handshake, the server and client send each other encrypted data. If each can decode the other's test data, they know they have a matched pair of keys, which proves that both are the same client and server that got the keys from the trusted authority.</p><p>Why not just use asymmetric encryption for the data itself, if it's more secure? Mainly, protocols don't do this because it's a lot slower. Asymmetric encryption requires a lot of resource-heavy math that makes connections drag. That's why OpenVPN and others use the asymmetric-to-symmetric two-step instead.</p><p>To summarize, a VPN protocol is a complex set of instructions and tools that control encryption and routing via VPN servers. Protocols still in use include OpenVPN, WireGuard, IKEv2, SSTP and L2TP. PPTP, one of the oldest protocols, is no longer considered secure. On top of these, VPNs often build their own proprietary protocols, such as ExpressVPN's Lightway.</p><h2 id=""194fe0d7-96f6-4022-bc10-fa63aa7f4be1""><strong>Putting it all together</strong></h2><p>Now that we've hit all the relevant information, let's revisit that step-by-step from earlier, this time with a VPN in the mix. Here are the steps, starting with establishing the VPN connection and ending with anonymously viewing a website.</p><ol><li><p>You open your VPN client, choose a server location and connect. The VPN client and server authenticate each other with a TLS handshake.</p></li><li><p>The client and server exchange the symmetric keys they'll use to encrypt and decrypt packets for the duration of this session (i.e. until you disconnect). Your VPN client tells you that it's established a secure tunnel.</p></li><li><p>You open your web browser and enter a URL. Your browser sends a request to view the content at that address.</p></li><li><p>The request goes to your VPN client, which encrypts it and adds an outer layer of information with directions to the VPN server.</p></li><li><p>The encrypted request reaches the VPN server, which decrypts it and forwards it to your ISP.</p></li><li><p>As normal, your ISP finds the IP address associated with the URL you entered and forwards your request along.</p></li><li><p>The destination server receives the request and sends all the necessary packets of information back to your ISP, which forwards it to the VPN server.</p></li><li><p>The VPN server encrypts each packet and adds a header directing it to the VPN client.</p></li><li><p>The client decrypts the packets and forwards them to your web browser.</p></li><li><p>You see the web page you opened.</p></li></ol><p>Because of the encrypted tunnel, the request arrives at the VPN server without any information on where it came from. Thus, the VPN doesn't actually encrypt your activity on the websites themselves — for the most part, the HTTPS protocol does that. Instead, a VPN gives you a false name to put in the register, with no information that could be traced back to your real identity.</p><h2 id=""6588ec1f-d408-4bde-bda5-ba8ecd56620e""><strong>How to use this information</strong></h2><p>Now that you know how a VPN works on a technical level, you're better equipped to choose one for yourself. You can cut through marketing hype statements like:</p><ul><li><p>&quot;Military-grade encryption!&quot; (It's the same algorithm everybody uses)</p></li><li><p>&quot;Stay completely anonymous online!&quot; (Plaintext you post on social media is not encrypted)</p></li><li><p>&quot;Dodge ISP throttling!&quot; (If your ISP is throttling you based on your IP address, this works — but if you're being slowed down because of your moment-to-moment activity, your identity doesn't matter)</p></li></ul><p>A VPN is just one important part of a <a class=""link"" href=""https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/12-steps-you-can-take-right-now-to-be-safer-online-130008335.html"" target=""_blank"">complete cybersecurity breakfast</a>. While hiding your IP address, make sure to also use strong passwords, download updates immediately and remain alert for social engineering tactics.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-a-vpn-works-and-why-you-should-care-143000250.html?src=rss",Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics,TECH
"Wed, 17 Dec 2025 14:17:16 +0000",Samsung will show off its expanded Micro RGB TV series at CES,"<p>Last year at CES, Samsung <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsungs-new-29999-micro-rgb-tv-looks-ridiculously-good-194629549.html"">debuted</a> its first mainstream Micro RGB TV, a 115-inch model that surprised us with its rich, vivid colors and $30,000 price tag. Now, the company has <a href=""https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-expands-premium-micro-rgb-lineup-for-2026-with-new-sizes-and-advanced-features"">announced</a> that it will be showing off an entire lineup of Micro RGB TVs at CES 2026 ranging from 55- to 115-inch models, promising to set &quot;a new standard for premium home viewing.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a reminder, Micro RGB is a unique new technology similar to Mini LED displays. Unlike the white backlights used on Mini LEDs, though, it uses tiny red, green and blue LEDs that produce more accurate colors and offer smaller and more controllable dimming zones. However, because pixels can't be turned on and off individually like Micro LED or OLED, Micro RGB contrast ratios aren't as high. They promise to be brighter and more color accurate than other technologies, though, hence the high prices and &quot;premium&quot; branding.&nbsp;</p>
<span id=""end-legacy-contents""></span><p>Samsung's upcoming Micro RGB lineup will be available in 55-, 65-, 75-, 85-, 100- and 115-inch models and use the next evolution of the company's technology. The main claim to fame is near broadcast monitor-like color accuracy, covering 100 percent of the demanding BT.2020 HDR standard. That new standard now has a name and VDE certification: Micro RGB Precision Color 100.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other key features include Samsung's &quot;Micro RGB AI Engine Pro&quot; for more precise frame-by-frame clarity and realism, new color enhancement functions, Samsung's glare free tech and enhanced audio features including Dolby Atmos and Adaptive Sound Pro.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday, LG <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-will-debut-its-first-micro-rgb-television-at-ces-010037923.html"">announced</a> that it would also show off new televisions using Micro RGB technology, with 75-, 86- and 100-inch models coming next year. What remains to be seen, however, is pricing. Given the $30,000 cost of the 115-inch model, you can likely expect the first Micro RGB televisions to be among the most expensive in the lineups of both LG and Samsung.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-will-show-off-its-expanded-micro-rgb-tv-series-at-ces-141716449.html?src=rss",Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics,TECH

Discovery's board has formally rejected the $108 billion takeover bid from Paramount Skydance, the company <a href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/warner-bros-discovery-board-of-directors-unanimously-recommends-shareholders-reject-paramount-tender-offer-302644592.html"">announced</a>. WBD said it remains committed to its <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/netflix-to-buy-warner-bros-for-827-billion-120836295.html"">$82.7 billion deal</a> with Netflix, which would close some time next year, pending regulatory approval.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;[The board] has unanimously determined that the tender offer launched by Paramount Skydance on December 8, 2025 is not in the best interests of WBD and its shareholders and does not meet the criteria of a &quot;Superior Proposal&quot; under the terms of WBD's merger agreement with Netflix announced on December 5, 2025,&quot; the studio said in the press release.&nbsp;</p>
<span id=""end-legacy-contents""></span><p>Paramount's offer was funded in part by sovereign wealth funds from Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Abu Dhabi, so it could have triggered a national security review by the US government. However, Paramount said that even if those entities dropped out, the company's owners (the Ellisons) would &quot;backstop the full amount of the bid.&quot;</p>
<p>However, the board said that Paramount &quot;has consistently misled WBD shareholders that its proposed transaction has a 'full backstop' from the Ellison family. It does not, and never has,&quot; adding that &quot;the terms of the Netflix merger are superior.&quot; WBD explained that Paramount is relying on an &quot;opaque revocable trust&quot; for said backstop which is &quot;no replacement for a secured commitment by a controlling shareholder.&quot; WBD's board also noted that Paramount expects to achieve $9 billion in cost synergies from the merger, and that &quot;would make Hollywood weaker, not stronger.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a <a href=""https://ir.netflix.net/investor-news-and-events/financial-releases/press-release-details/2025/Netflix-Welcomes-Warner-Bros--Discovery-Board-Recommendation/default.aspx"">statement</a>, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said that &quot;the Warner Bros. Discovery board reinforced that Netflix's merger agreement is superior and that our acquisition is in the best interest of stockholders. This was a competitive process that delivered the best outcome for consumers, creators, stockholders and the broader entertainment industry.&quot;</p>
<p>Paramount has yet to comment, but the company has previously said that its $30 per share offer is a better deal, due to the all-cash nature (compared to 84 percent cash for Netflix) and fact that it would have a clearer path to regulatory approval due to the Ellison's supposedly tight relationship with President Trump.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/warner-bros-discovery-rejects-paramounts-hostile-bid-131055882.html?src=rss",Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics,TECH

<h2 id=""jump-link-gaming-subscriptions"">Gaming subscriptions</h2> 
<p>Game consoles are certainly among the most popular gift ideas this time of year. If you know someone who’s been so good that they’re getting a new Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X/S, one of these subscriptions will make their shiny toy immediately playable out of the box.</p> <span id=""end-legacy-contents""></span>
<p>
 </p> 
<p>There’s no doubt that Microsoft has changed the value proposition for its Game Pass subscription service service. It recently <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-jacks-the-price-of-game-pass-ultimate-up-to-30-a-month-142441307.html"">raised the price</a> for its most comprehensive Ultimate tier by 50 percent, to $30 a month. That’s a bitter pill to swallow —&nbsp;but devoted players who have an Xbox as their main (or only) console will still get a ton of value out of Game Pass.</p> 
<p>The aforementioned Ultimate tier provides access to more than 500 games that’ll work on Xbox, PC and other supported devices. It’s also the only way to get “day one” release games like <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> <em>Ninja Gaiden 4, The Outer World 2, Call of Duty Black Ops 7</em>; in recent years other high-profile day one releases have included <em>Doom: The Dark Ages, Starfield, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Forza Motorsport</em> and numerous others. Game Pass Ultimate subscribers also have access to the highest quality and fastest game streaming Xbox offers. For a slightly less hardcore Xbox fan, though, the $15-per-month Premium tier is also worth considering.</p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>Nintendo’s Switch Online subscription has gotten some nice upgrades in 2025, the year of the Switch 2. As it has for years, Nintendo offers two different Switch Online plans. The basic $20-per-year plan unlocks online play and enables Switch 2 owners to use the system's GameChat capabilities. It also includes more than 100 Game Boy, NES and Super NES games, cloud backups of your saved games as well as the occasional special offers. It also includes access to the rather silly but enjoyable Nintendo Music app, so you can listen to your favorite Zelda or Mario tracks at any time.</p> 
<p>The $50 “expansion pack” adds a collection of N64, Game Boy Advance and Sega Genesis games as well as some DLC for games like <em>Mario Kart 8, Animal Crossing: New Horizons </em>and <em>Splatoon 2.</em> But most interesting are the new additions for Switch 2 owners: there’s a small but growing library of GameCube games, including classics like <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker </em>and <em>F-Zero GX.</em> Switch 2 owners who have the expansion pack subscription can also upgrade to the Switch 2 versions of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> for free.</p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>A PlayStation Plus subscription is a must-have for any PS5 owners. That’s partially because you need one to play multiplayer games online, but there are plenty of other significant benefits. PS Plus comes in three tiers, but the middle “Extra” plan ($15/month or $135/year) is probably best for most gamers. In addition to cloud storage for saves, online multiplayer support and a couple of free games for your library every month, you get access to the PlayStation Plus catalog, which includes more than 400 PS4 and PS5 games.</p> 
<p>There are a number of heavy hitters here, including <em>The Last of Us Part I</em> and <em>II</em>, <em>Ghost of Tsushima, God of War Ragnarok, Death Stranding, Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered </em>and <em>Returnal</em> alongside lower-profile hits and indie games such as <em>Citizen Sleeper, Sayonara Wild Hearts, Dave the Diver </em>and<em> Humanity</em>. If you know someone who loves older games though, the “Premium” tier ($18/month or $160/year) adds a bunch of titles from the PS1 through the PS4 as well as perks like game trials and PS5 game streaming from the cloud.</p>

"Wed, 17 Dec 2025 13:00:00 +0000",Alexa Home Theater: Everything you need to know about Amazon's newest Echo feature,"<p>When Amazon’s latest Echo speakers arrived in October, a feature the company spent time hyping <a class=""link"" href=""https://www.engadget.com/home/everything-announced-at-amazons-fall-hardware-event-143557140.html"" target=""_blank"">during its fall devices event</a> was missing.

The main selling point is that the underlying tech allows you to put the speakers wherever you want and Alexa Home Theater will handle the rest. A robust array of speakers is a considerable investment, though, and there are limitations to Amazon’s latest play for your living room.</p><h2 id=""6ba76f50-c630-458b-aad1-e48fdaab1636"">What is Alexa Home Theater?</h2><p>At the most basic level, <a class=""link"" href=""https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/alexa-home-theater-will-let-you-use-amazons-echo-speakers-for-surround-sound-153325469.html"" target=""_blank"">Alexa Home Theater</a> is an automatic room calibration tool that’s akin to Trueplay from Sonos, SpaceFit Sound from Samsung or Sound Field Optimization from Sony. The feature, no matter which company builds it, is designed to automatically tune the acoustics of a soundbar or other speakers to the acoustics of the room. These tools allow companies to account for things like high ceilings and weird angles, adjusting audio performance so things sound their best no matter how your home is designed.&nbsp;</p><p>Like similar technologies from other companies, Alexa Home Theater and the latest Echo speakers also support spatial awareness. This allows you to position the speakers however they best fit in your living room and the underlying tech will balance the sound based on their proximity to each other. Gone are the days when you have to put rear speakers in a specific spot in order for them to work.&nbsp;</p><p>For the latest Echo speakers, Amazon overhauled Alexa Home Theater to accommodate more devices in a single setup. Now you can use up to five <a class=""link"" href=""https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/amazon-echo-dot-max-review-disappointing-sound-but-alexa-is-a-star-190000721.html"" target=""_blank"">Echo Dot Max</a> or <a class=""link"" href=""https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/amazon-echo-studio-2025-review-a-comprehensive-redesign-for-alexa-140000191.html"" target=""_blank"">second-generation Echo Studio</a> units and a subwoofer at the same time. Of course, this means you can put the compact speakers around the perimeter of your home theater space, providing more immersive surround sound than a single speaker or two can muster. Alexa Home Theater recognizes each Echo speaker and adjusts the system accordingly.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=""6748d315-b980-4569-9ffb-dcd3c13b1180"">What hardware do I need to use it?</h2><figure><img alt=""My test setup was four Echo Studio speakers and a Fire TV Stick 4K Max."" src=""https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/IMG_7661.jpg"" style=""height: 1440px; width: 2560px;"" /><figcaption>My test setup was four Echo Studio speakers and a Fire TV Stick 4K Max.</figcaption><div class=""photo-credit"">Billy Steele for Engadget</div></figure><p>If you want to use more than two Echo speakers and a subwoofer in your Alexa Home Theater setup, you’ll need the latest Amazon devices to make that happen.

Unlike a lot of the competition, this initial configuration isn’t done in a mobile app — it’s handled by the Settings menu on a compatible Fire TV device. Before you initiate the setup process, you’ll want to make sure your Echo speakers and Fire TV device are up to date. You can ask Alexa to check for updates to the speakers, while you’ll need to check the Device &amp; Software section of the Fire TV Settings menu for those gadgets. Once everything is current, here are the steps to follow to get started with Alexa Home Theater:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong> on your Fire TV.</p></li><li><p>Select <strong>Display &amp; Sounds.</strong>&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Select <strong>Alexa Home Theater</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Select <strong>Create Alexa Home Theater</strong>.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Select the compatible Echo speakers. You can also add an Echo Sub during this step.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Follow the on-screen instructions to configure the system. After you select either the second-gen Echo Studio or the Echo Dot Max, hit <strong>Next</strong> and the system will calibrate automatically. If you select other Echo speakers, hit <strong>Next</strong> and then confirm the placement of the speakers before calibration.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>When the setup is complete, the Alexa Home Theater system is ready to use. To do so, select either <strong>Home</strong> or <strong>Watch Preview</strong>.&nbsp;</p></li></ol><h2 id=""72c3e5ae-efb1-4322-9f77-da86691a989b"">Using Alexa Home Theater with four Echo Studio speakers</h2><figure><img alt=""The two Echo Studio speakers that flanked my TV primarily handled dialogue."" src=""https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/IMG_7655.jpg"" style=""height: 1440px; width: 2560px;"" /><figcaption>The two Echo Studio speakers that flanked my TV primarily handled dialogue.</figcaption><div class=""photo-credit"">Billy Steele for Engadget</div></figure><p>Like most home theater gear, the Fire TV will play short audio clips through each Echo speaker and your TV speakers to determine their location and to calibrate the group to the room. From start to finish, the setup process takes about five minutes — so long as your Fire TV and all speakers are running up-to-date firmware. It’s a quick and straightforward process, which meant I was watching <em>Fallout </em>soon after putting all of the speakers in place.&nbsp;</p><p>While streaming that video game-inspired original series, the Echo Studios provided an immersive audio experience with directional sound and crisp, clear dialogue. The front two speakers handle speech, but there’s some nuance in what direction it’s coming from on screen. Rear speakers are tasked with the bulk of the environmental noise, whether that’s nearby water, passing cars, rain or gunfire — just to name a few. I was also pleasantly surprised by how much bassy rumble these speakers produced during movies and shows. I didn’t think a single unit was particularly adept at low-end tone during my review, but I think it would be just fine to use a collection of Echo Studios without having to add the Echo Sub.&nbsp;</p><p>The overall audio performance here is certainly a boost over any TV’s built-in speakers, but the sense of immersion isn’t as complete as what a soundbar and a pair of rear satellite speakers can provide. Specifically, I felt like the foursome of Echo Studio speakers in my test setup stumbled with the height channels. Despite the angled design of the devices and their multi-driver configurations, the effect of overhead and aerial sounds was quite subdued.&nbsp;</p><p>And the worst part about this is that there’s no way to try to fix it with settings. That’s because there are minimal settings to adjust once Alexa Home Theater is set up. There are two features — dialogue boost and volume leveler — but those are both Fire TV settings rather than items meant for any connected speakers. In the Alexa Home Theater menu, there’s a lip sync tool to address any audio lag, which is a standard item for any soundbar. I would’ve loved to see some kind of channel adjustment at the very least, so that I could dial in the mix a bit rather than relying on Amazon’s preferences.&nbsp;</p><p>If you turn to Alexa for help, the assistant can only change bass, treble and midrange, and it can only do so when prompted by voice commands. When I asked for it to turn up the dialogue, it seemed to just increase the volume. If I asked it to adjust the height channels, Alexa responded affirmatively, but it didn’t sound like any tweaks were applied.&nbsp;Amazon later confirmed that those basic EQ changes are Alexa and actually do here. </p><p>Another gripe I have with Alexa Home Theater is the inability to connect my phone or another device to the entire group for music. You can still sync with individual Echo Studio speakers for music via Bluetooth, but if you want to use the whole shebang, you’ll have to play your tunes from the Fire TV or ask Alexa to help.&nbsp;</p><p>The Fire TV platform has plenty of audio streaming apps, but Apple Music isn’t there and that’s where my monthly subscription resides. You have to add the Apple Music skill to the Alexa app on your phone first, then you can stream content from the service by asking Amazon’s assistant. For other services with Fire TV apps, you’re using your TV to play music, and most of the time I want the TV off and to just pick up my phone to blast some Spiritbox. I also like to control the queue from my phone, but alas that’s not an option here.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=""7d812f3c-8d33-4c3f-ab25-051c43c35408"">Wrap-up</h2><figure><img alt=""Amazon's new Echo Studio is a complete redesign from the 2019 model."" src=""https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/IMG_7344.jpg"" style=""height: 1440px; width: 2560px;"" /><figcaption>Amazon's new Echo Studio is a complete redesign from the 2019 model.</figcaption><div class=""photo-credit"">Billy Steele for Engadget</div></figure><p>The main issue with using four Echo Studios and a Fire TV is the cost. For the speakers alone, you’re looking at nearly $900 for the setup I tested. When the new Echo speakers were announced in September, Amazon said it would offer Alexa Home Theater bundles with multiple speakers, but I couldn’t find those on the company’s website. </p><p>For comparison, Sonos currently offers multiple configurations of <a class=""link"" href=""https://www.engadget.com/sonos-beam-gen-2-review-dolby-atmos-soundbar-130024506.html"" target=""_blank"">the Beam soundbar</a> and either <a class=""link"" href=""https://www.engadget.com/sonos-era-100-review-affordable-multi-room-audio-that-actually-sounds-good-130007717.html"" target=""_blank"">Era 100 speakers</a> or a sub for less than $800. For the same price as four Echo Studio speakers, you can get <a class=""link"" href=""https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/sony-adds-the-bravia-theater-bar-6-to-its-dolby-atmos-soundbar-lineup-160012544.html"" target=""_blank"">Sony’s Bravia Theater System 6</a>, which comes with a soundbar, rear speakers and a subwoofer. There are other options from other companies as well in the $800 range, and most people will likely be happier with a dedicated soundbar-based setup than four Echo units and a subwoofer. Hello, AirPlay and Google Cast.</p><p>From an aesthetic perspective, I can see why someone might opt for multiple Echo speakers instead of a mid-sized (or larger) soundbar. Two Echo Studios on either side of my TV with the two rear units tucked away on a shelf certainly creates a clean look. And in terms of sound, using two Echo Studio speakers, let alone four like I tested, will provide a noticeable boost over a TV’s built-in speakers. However, the lack of customization and the inability to control music from my phone for an Alexa Home Theater group makes it hard to recommend Amazon’s latest for shoppers looking for more immersive audio in the living room. Hopefully the company will continue to refine this feature so that it’s more capable in the future.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/alexa-home-theater-everything-you-need-to-know-about-amazons-newest-echo-feature-130000328.html?src=rss",Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics,TECH
"Wed, 17 Dec 2025 10:36:53 +0000",Amazon in talks to invest $10 billion in OpenAI and supply its Trainium chips,"<p>Amazon is in discussions with OpenAI to invest $10 billion in the company while supplying more of its AI chips and cloud computing services, according to <a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/4217107e-2c98-4b78-9961-67d75237fac4""><em>The Financial Times</em></a>. The deal would push OpenAI's valuation over $500 billion but is likely to raise more questions about the company's circular investment agreements involving chips and data centers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two companies are also in talks about the possibility of OpenAI helping Amazon with its online marketplace, similar to deals it has made with Etsy, Shopify and Instacart. However, any agreement still wouldn't allow Amazon to market OpenAI's most advanced models on its developer cloud platform, as Microsoft holds the exclusive rights to those until the 2030s.&nbsp;</p>
<span id=""end-legacy-contents""></span><p>OpenAI <a href=""https://www.transportenvironment.org/articles/smoke-screen-the-growing-phev-emissions-scandal"">recently restructured</a> its agreement with Microsoft to allow it to use data center capacity from other suppliers. Around the same time, it made a string of deals with <a href=""https://www.transportenvironment.org/articles/smoke-screen-the-growing-phev-emissions-scandal"">NVIDIA</a>, Oracle, <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-agrees-to-buy-tens-of-billions-worth-of-amd-chips-134816630.html"">AMD</a> and others to build out data center capacity and acquire or rent AI chips.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new deal would require OpenAI to use Amazon's Trainium AI chips and rent more data center capacity from Amazon Web Services (AWS). That's on top of the $38 billion that OpenAI has already committed to renting servers from AWS over the next seven years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These deals have sounded alarms among investors considering their circular nature. In many of those, including this latest Amazon deal, OpenAI is taking investment money and then sending that cash back to the same company for infrastructure or chips. And the amounts are staggering, with just two companies, Softbank and Oracle, spending a combined $400 billion on new data centers for OpenAI's compute needs. And so far, OpenAI has lost more money than it makes.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/amazon-in-talks-to-invest-10-billion-in-openai-and-supply-its-trainium-chips-103653151.html?src=rss",Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics,TECH

<h3 id=""jump-link-what-is-chrome-os-and-why-would-i-use-it-over-windows"">What is Chrome OS, and why would I use it over Windows?</h3> 
<p>This is probably the number one question about Chromebooks. There are plenty of inexpensive Windows laptops on the market, so why bother with Chrome's operating system? Glad you asked. For me, the simple and clean nature of Chrome OS is a big selling point. Chrome OS is based on Google’s Chrome browser, which means most of the programs you can run are web based. There’s no bloatware or unwanted apps to uninstall like you often get on Windows laptops, it boots up in seconds, and you can completely reset to factory settings almost as quickly.</p> <span id=""end-legacy-contents""></span>
<p>Of course, simplicity will also be a major drawback for some users. Not being able to install native software can be a dealbreaker if you’re a video editor or software developer. But there are also plenty of people who do the majority of their work in a web browser, using tools like Google Docs and spreadsheets for productivity without needing a full Windows setup.</p> 
<p>Google and its software partners are getting better every year at supporting more advanced features. For example, Google added video editing tools to the Google Photos app on Chromebooks – it won’t replace Adobe Premiere, but it should be handy for a lot of people. Similarly, Google and Adobe announced Photoshop on the web in 2023, something that brings much of the power of Adobe’s desktop apps to Chromebooks.</p> 
<p>Chromebooks can also run Android apps, which greatly expands the amount of software available. The quality varies widely, but it means you can do more with a Chromebook beyond just web-based apps. For example, you can install the Netflix app and save videos for offline watching. Other Android apps like Microsoft Office and Adobe Lightroom are surprisingly capable as well. Between Android apps and a general improvement in web apps, Chromebooks are more than just portals to a browser.</p> 
<h3 id=""jump-link-what-do-chromebooks-do-well"">What do Chromebooks do well?</h3>

<p>Put simply, web browsing and really anything web based. Online shopping, streaming music and video and using various social media sites are among the most common daily tasks people do on Chromebooks. As you might expect, they also work well with Google services like Photos, Docs, Gmail, Drive, Keep and so on. Yes, any computer that can run Chrome can do that too, but the lightweight nature of Google Chrome OS makes it a responsive and stable platform.</p> 
<p>As I mentioned before, Chrome OS can run Android apps, so if you’re an Android user you’ll find some nice ties between the platforms. You can get most of the same apps that are on your phone on a Chromebook and keep info in sync between them. You can also use some Android phones as a security key for your Chromebook or instantly tether your 2-in-1 laptop to use mobile data.</p> 
<p>Google continues to tout security as a major differentiator for Chromebooks, and it’s definitely a factor worth considering. Auto-updates are the first lines of defense: Chrome OS updates download quickly in the background and a fast reboot is all it takes to install the latest version. Google says that each webpage and app on a Chromebook runs in its own sandbox as well, so any security threats are contained to that individual app. Finally, Chrome OS has a self-check called Verified Boot that runs every time a device starts up. Beyond all this, the simple fact that you generally can’t install traditional apps on a Chromebook means there are fewer ways for bad actors to access the system.</p> 
<p>If you’re interested in Google’s Gemini AI tools, a Chromebook is a good option as well. Every Chromebook in our top picks comes with a full year of <a href=""https://one.google.com/about/google-ai-plans/"">Google’s AI Pro plan</a> — this combines the usual Google One perks like 2TB of storage and 10 percent back in purchases from the Google Store with a bunch of AI tools. You’ll get access to Gemini in Chrome, Gmail, Google Docs and other apps, Gemini 2.5 Pro in the Gemini app and more. Given that this plan is $20/month, it’s a pretty solid perk. Chromebook Plus models also include tools like the AI-powered “help me write,” the Google Photos Magic Editor and generative AI backgrounds you can create by filling in a few prompts.</p> 
<p>As for when to avoid Chromebooks, the answer is simple: If you rely heavily on a specific native application for Windows or a Mac, chances are you won’t find the exact same option on a ChromeOS device. That’s most true in fields like photo and video editing, but it can also be the case in law or finance. Plenty of businesses run on Google’s G suite software, but more still have specific requirements that a Chromebook might not match. If you’re an iPhone user, you’ll also miss out on the way the iPhone easily integrates with an iPad or Mac. For me, the big downside is not being able to access iMessage on a Chromebook.</p> 
<p>Finally, gaming Chromebooks are not ubiquitous, although they’re becoming a slightly more reasonable option with the rise of cloud gaming. In late 2022, Google and some hardware partners announced a push to make Chromebooks with cloud gaming in mind. From a hardware perspective, that means laptops with bigger screens that have higher refresh rates as well as optimizing those laptops to work with services like NVIDIA GeForce Now, Xbox Game Pass and Amazon Luna. You’ll obviously need an internet connection to use these services, but the good news is that playing modern games on a Chromebook isn’t impossible. You can also install Android games from the Google Play Store, but that’s not what most people are thinking of when they want to game on a laptop.</p> 
<h3 id=""jump-link-what-are-the-most-important-specs-for-a-chromebook"">What are the most important specs for a Chromebook?</h3> 
<figure>
 <img src=""https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/802219e0-e781-11ee-9dfb-c69cf3b4e4c4"" />

<p>Chrome OS is lightweight and runs well on fairly modest hardware, so the most important thing to look for might not be processor power or storage space. But Google made it easier to get consistent specs and performance late last year when it introduced the Chromebook Plus initiative. Any device with a Chromebook Plus designation meets some minimum requirements, which happen to be very similar to what I’d recommend most people get if they’re looking for the best laptop they can use every day.</p> 
<p>Chromebook Plus models have at least a 12th-gen Intel Core i3 processor, or an AMD Ryzen 3 7000 series processor, both of which should be more than enough for most people. These laptops also have a minimum of 8GB of RAM and 128GB of SSD storage, which should do the trick unless you’re really pushing your Chromebook. All Chromebook Plus models have to have a 1080p webcam, which is nice in these days of constant video calling, and they also all have to have at least a 1080p FHD IPS screen.</p> 
<p>Of course, you can get higher specs or better screens if you desire, but I’ve found that basically everything included in the Chromebook Plus target specs makes for a very good experience.</p> 
<p>Google has an Auto Update policy for Chromebooks as well, and while that’s not exactly a spec, it’s worth checking before you buy. Last year, Google announced that Chromebooks would get software updates and support for an impressive 10 years after their release date. This support page lists the Auto Update expiration date for virtually every Chromebook ever, but a good rule of thumb is to buy the newest machine you can to maximize your support.</p> 
<h3 id=""jump-link-how-much-should-i-spend-on-a-chromebook"">How much should I spend on a Chromebook?</h3> 
<p>Chromebooks started out notoriously cheap, with list prices often coming in under $300. But as they’ve gone more mainstream, they’ve transitioned from being essentially modern netbooks to some of the best laptops you’ll want to use all day. As such, prices have increased: At this point, you should expect to spend at least $400 if you want a solid daily driver. There are still many Chromebooks out there available at a low price that may be suitable as secondary devices, but a good Chromebook that can be an all-day, every-day laptop will cost more. But, notably, even the best Chromebooks usually cost less than the best Windows laptops, or even the best “regular” laptops out there.</p> 
<p>There are a handful of premium Chromebooks that approach or even exceed $1,000 that claim to offer better performance and more processing power, but I don’t recommend spending that much. Generally, that’ll get you a better design with more premium materials, as well as more powerful internals and extra storage space, like a higher-capacity SSD. Of course, you also sometimes pay for the brand name. But, the specs I outlined earlier are usually enough, and there are multiple good premium Chromebooks in the $700 to $800 range at this point.</p>

It’s a few years older than our current top pick, so its processor isn’t fresh and it only has 128GB of storage. It also won’t get updates from Google as long as newer models. But it still combines a nice screen and keyboard with solid performance. This laptop typically costs $500, which feels high given its a few years old and Acer’s Chromebook Plus 514 is only $350, but if you can find it on sale and can’t find the Acer it’s worth a look.</p>

That price and its large 15.6-inch screen is mainly what it has going for it, as the Intel Celeron N4500 chip and 4GB of RAM powering it does not provide good performance if you’re doing anything more than browsing with a few tabs open. If you’re shopping for someone with extremely basic needs and have a small budget, the CX15 might fit the bill. But just be aware that you get what you pay for.</p> 
<h3 id=""jump-link-samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus"">Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus</h3> 
<p>Samsung’s <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review-quirky-in-ways-both-good-and-bad-140036965.html"">Galaxy Chromebook Plus</a>, released in late 2024, is one of the more unique Chromebooks out there. It’s extremely thin and light, at 0.46 inches and 2.6 pounds, but it manages to include a 15.6-inch display in that frame. That screen is a 1080p panel that’s sharp and bright, but its 16:9 aspect ratio made things feel a bit cramped when scrolling vertically. Performance is very good, and the keyboard is solid, though I’m not a fan of the number pad as it shifts everything to the left. At $700 it’s not cheap, but that feels fair considering its size and capabilities. If you’re looking for a big screen laptop that is also super light, this Chromebook merits consideration, even if it’s not the best option for everyone.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-chromebooks-160054646.html?src=rss",Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics,TECH

Microsoft released the latest Wireless Headset as an accessory for Xbox Series X/S and PC, but as of this update, Xbox Wireless Headset owners on Windows will now have a leg up on their console counterparts thanks to support for Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) Audio.</p><p>Microsoft says that supporting Bluetooth LE Audio will let the headset offer lower latency audio, better battery life, richer stereo sound and the ability to share audio across multiple compatible Bluetooth accessories at the same time. Not revolutionary updates, but still nice to have if you bought a $110 Xbox Wireless Headset back in 2024. Provided you're running the latest version of Windows 11 and your device supports Bluetooth LE, Microsoft says you can take advantage of the improvements by updating your headset in the Xbox Accessories app.</p><p>If you're a regular user of the Xbox mobile app, Microsoft is also making some changes there.

They offer an AI layer to web browsing: provide a natural language input, get an interactive widget that does what you asked for.

A good game takes what might be a simple idea and, with finesse and iteration and skill, transforms it into a genuinely fun experience. It's a cute parlor trick that AI assistants can help people to make stuff without technical knowledge, but there's a reason professional game devs work hard to amass all their know-how. Playables Builder is a peak example of misunderstanding what artificial intelligence is best at.

Holiday discounts running through December 29 bring the anime streaming service's year-long Fan subscription from $80 down to $67 and its Mega Fan subscription from $120 down to $100. That's either $13 or $20 off access to one of the largest libraries of anime series and movies out there.</p> 
<p>While both the Fan and Mega Fan plans are ad-free, you do get some different benefits depending on which you decide to pay for. Fan subscribers get full access to Crunchyroll's library, new episodes &quot;shortly after they air in Japan&quot; and five percent off select purchases in the Crunchyroll Store. Mega Fan subscribers get all those benefits, plus the ability to stream on four devices at the same time, download HD quality episodes and movies to view offline, play games from the Crunchyroll Game Vault and receive 10 percent off select products in the Crunchyroll Store.</p> <span id=""end-legacy-contents""></span>
<p>
 </p> 
<p>Notably missing from either subscription is access to <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/a-new-crunchyroll-manga-mobile-app-arrives-later-this-year-155234860.html""><ins>Crunchyroll's new Manga service</ins></a>, but unless you're specifically looking for reading material, you'll get plenty of entertainment out of Crunchyroll's video library. Outside of Netflix, which produces and licenses its own growing collection of anime, Crunchyroll is the de facto place to watch Japanese animation in the US. You'll find long-running series like <em>One Piece</em> and newer hits like <em>Spy X Family</em>, alongside hundreds of more niche series.</p> 
<p>Crunchyroll has its issues, of course. Since the streaming service was <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/sony-completes-crunchyroll-acquisition-220920170.html""><ins>acquired by Sony</ins></a>, it's been particularly interested in using generative AI to subtitle shows, which has already <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/crunchyroll-blames-third-party-vendor-for-ai-subtitle-mess-145621606.html""><ins>produced poor results</ins></a>.

"Tue, 16 Dec 2025 18:00:00 +0000",ChatGPT image generation is now faster and better at following tweaks,"<p>Following the release of <a class=""link"" href=""https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-releases-gpt-52-to-take-on-google-and-anthropic-185029007.html"" target=""_blank"">GPT-5.2 last week</a>, OpenAI has begun <a class=""link"" href=""https://openai.com/index/new-chatgpt-images-is-here/"" target=""_blank"">rolling out a new image generation model</a>. The company says the updated ChatGPT Images is four times faster than its predecessor. If you're a frequent ChatGPT user, you'll know it can sometimes take a while for OpenAI's servers to create images, particularly during peak times and if you're not paying for ChatGPT Plus. In that respect, any improvement in speed is welcome. </p><p>The new version is also better at following instructions, including when you want to edit something the new model just generated. You can ask the system to add, subtract, combine, blend and even transpose elements.&nbsp;At the same time, OpenAI says the update offers better text rendering. That's something many image models have traditionally struggled with, but according to the company, the new ChatGPT Images is capable of handling denser and smaller text. As part of the today's model update, OpenAI is additionally adding a dedicated Images section to the ChatGPT sidebar. Here you'll find preset filters and prompts you can look to for inspiration.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt=""A portrait of Sam Altman, in the style of Johannes Vermeer's Girl with a Pearl Earring.

After all, iRobot’s US gear is made in Vietnam, which is now subject to a 46 percent import levy. As <a class=""link"" href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1lr75lp239o"" target=""_blank""><em>BBC News</em></a> reported, that added around $23 million to iRobot’s costs and increased the price of its hardware.</p><p>The real answer is that iRobot’s demise was caused by a perfect storm of all these factors piling on to the company. More importantly, iRobot’s situation isn’t any way unique, and should serve as a warning to every major American technology brand. It’s also a lesson in why companies need to deal with existential threats when they have the time and cash to do so.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, once iRobot perfected the concept for the Roomba, it wasn’t long before the first copies burst onto the scene. iRobot had the brand and the know-how, but that only goes so far against well-motivated copycats. Think about the first Samsung Android handsets, and how quickly they went from iPhone imitations to class-defining devices of their own — and <a class=""link"" href=""https://www.engadget.com/2012-08-25-breaking-down-apples-1-billion-courtroom-victory-over-samsung.html"" target=""_blank"">how hard Apple fought in court</a> to prevent it.</p><p>Even before this year’s tariffs, iRobot struggled to compete on price in a manner we’ve seen in other fields. Remember Fitbit before Google purchased it, happily selling $80 fitness trackers for years until Xiaomi swiped the low-end part of its business for itself. Even if the early MiBands weren’t very good, you could buy three for the price of a single Fitbit Charge. Yes, the argument around quality and reliability is important, but it’s often not as loud or compelling as a competing product sold for a fraction of the price.</p><p>iRobot should have either made more of an effort to offer a dirt-cheap model to undercut its rivals, or more likely pull out of the low end altogether. Earlier today, I checked out local retail listings for Roombas and its nearest competitors. Next to one another were the Roomba 405 Combo with Dock and the Roborock Q7 L5+ — both capable of vacuuming and mopping your floor. The former is currently on sale for $400 direct from iRobot, while the latter is currently selling for $220. I’m sure plenty of buyers would have seen the price difference and opted for the cheaper model.</p><p>I’m not going to throw too many Told You So’s over iRobot’s fence for not embracing LiDAR sooner. Its omission was a mistake, but you could see why it was shy about abandoning its existing setup. But the company had forgotten one key mantra about the tech world, Andy Grove’s maxim that “only the paranoid survive.” Even the fanciest, highest-end Roombas of the last five years felt a generation behind rival products.</p><p>And, at the risk of sounding like a marketing guru, it was never clear what iRobot, or Roomba, stood for. When companies flooded the market with cheaper models, iRobot needed to make it clear what it <em>meant</em> when you bought a Roomba over a generic model. What did, and could, it offer beyond the name and history that made it stand out against cheaper competitors? Companies like Apple and Dyson command a premium, but you almost always know what you’re getting for your money.</p><p>All I can say is that it’s good that there isn’t another American company presently in a similar position. I <em>certainly</em> can’t think of a controversial US company that builds things with wheels that has historically rejected <a class=""link"" href=""https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/tesla-says-it-has-been-testing-driverless-model-ys-in-austin-for-several-days-123037251.html"" target=""_blank"">LiDAR</a> for its autonomous services. One that has a brand that doesn’t stand for much, or has its identity tied too closely to the identity of its CEO. One that is staring down the barrel at a raft of <a class=""link"" href=""https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/byd-unveils-new-tech-for-twice-as-fast-ev-charging-175729412.html"" target=""_blank"">better</a> <a class=""link"" href=""https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/chinese-ev-maker-byd-promises-to-make-all-of-its-models-self-driving-capable-164641323.html"" target=""_blank"">equipped</a> and often cheaper Chinese alternatives. Because that company could surely be looking at a similar fate a decade or so down the road.</p><p><br /></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/what-happened-to-irobot-can-happen-to-anyone-164500625.html?src=rss",Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics,TECH

"Tue, 16 Dec 2025 16:00:03 +0000",Instagram launches a Fire TV app for Reels,"<p>Have you ever just wished you could watch Instagram Reels right on a TV? Maybe? Well, if so, you're in luck. Meta has launched an Instagram app exclusively on Fire TV. It will be solely for &quot;short-form video content,&quot; so Reels. <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-fire-tv-app-202229014.html"">TikTok launched an app</a> on Fire TV in 2020 before <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-tv-app-google-tv-samsung-lg-smart-tv-065700895.html"">rolling it out</a> to other platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instagram and <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/amazon-unveils-a-new-fire-tv-lineup-including-the-40-fire-tv-stick-4k-select-144541988.html"">Fire TV</a> users can download the former through Amazon's App Store. It can either link to an existing account or have a separate account just for TV. The app can hold up to five different Instagram accounts — and time spent factors into any limits on teen accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<span id=""end-legacy-contents""></span><p>&quot;Our mission is to get you to the world’s best content fast, and we’re thrilled to welcome Instagram to Fire TV,&quot; Fire TV vice president, Aidan Marcuss, said in a statement. &quot;We’re committed to keep pushing the boundaries of entertainment on customers' biggest screens — the Instagram team has built an awesome experience, and we’re excited to be the first place to offer it. We can’t wait to see what customers think.&quot;</p>
<p>For now, <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-adds-a-watch-history-for-reels-175555668.html"">Reels</a> are separated into different channels, such as sports highlights or hidden travel gems. Reels also play automatically, so you don't have to swipe between content on the screen. According to Meta, the app is still being tested, so these formats might change in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instagram users in the US can now get the TV app on Amazon's Fire TV Stick HD, 4K Plus and 4K Max (first and second generation). It's also available on the Fire RV 2-Series, 4-Series, and Omni QLED Series. However, Meta says that the Instagram App for TV should be available on more devices and in other countries after this initial testing round.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-launches-a-fire-tv-app-for-reels-160003710.html?src=rss",Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics,TECH

You make the choice once, but the surprises keep landing on their doorstep for months after that. For anyone who loves the buzz of a delivery, these are gifts that extend the season well past December. Each box on this list combines a bit of discovery with something tangible, such as gadgets, books, collectibles, snacks or clever projects. Some appeal to hardcore hobbyists, others to the curious or the comfort seekers, but all offer that same spark of delight that comes from unboxing something unexpected. These are the subscription boxes that make the best gifts to last all year.</p>

"Tue, 16 Dec 2025 14:30:25 +0000",PayPal applies to become a bank under Trump's looser financial rules,"<p><a href=""https://www.engadget.com/apps/google-wallets-paypal-integration-is-ending-this-june-133045777.html"">PayPal</a> is the latest company looking to become a bank in the US. On Monday, the <a href=""https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2025-12-15-PayPal-Submits-Applications-to-Establish-an-Industrial-Bank-to-Expand-Access-to-Financial-Services-for-U-S-Small-Businesses"">company announced</a> it had submitted applications for PayPal Bank to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions (UDFI). PayPal is already a bank in Europe, based in Luxembourg.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to PayPal, it has provided &quot;over $30 billion in loans and working capital&quot; for more than 420,000 business accounts globally. PayPal puts its focus on small businesses in pitching the need for a US bank. &quot;Securing capital remains a significant hurdle for small businesses striving to grow and scale,&quot; Alex Chriss, president and CEO of PayPal, said in a release. &quot;Establishing PayPal Bank will strengthen our business and improve our efficiency, enabling us to better support small business growth and economic opportunities across the US.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<span id=""end-legacy-contents""></span><p>PayPal also plans to provide &quot;interest-bearing saving accounts&quot; as a bank. If approved, it would be chartered in Utah.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Applications to become a bank have popped up left and right this year, with approval odds increasing under the Trump administration. On Friday, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) <a href=""https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2025/nr-occ-2025-125.html"">announced</a> that five cryptocurrency companies, including BitGo, Circle and Ripple, received conditional approval to become federally charted trust banks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;New entrants into the federal banking sector are good for consumers, the banking industry and the economy,&quot; the OCC's comptroller Jonathan V. Gould stated in the announcement. &quot;They provide access to new products, services and sources of credit to consumers, and ensure a dynamic, competitive and diverse banking system.&quot;</p>
<p>Other companies such as <a href=""https://usa.nissannews.com/en-US/releases/nissan-motor-acceptance-company-submits-application-to-form-nissan-bank-us-llc"">Nissan</a> and <a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sony-shocks-wall-street-tech-121217316.html"">Sony</a> have also submitted applications to form a bank.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/paypal-applies-to-become-a-bank-under-trumps-looser-financial-rules-143025772.html?src=rss",Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics,TECH
"Tue, 16 Dec 2025 14:00:00 +0000",Avatar Fire and Ash review: Maybe it's time to sunset Pandora,"<p>No matter what you think of James Cameron's <em>Avatar</em> movies,&nbsp;their technical ambitions are undeniable. Cameron <a class=""link"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_Camera_System"" target=""_blank"">developed his own camera system</a> to shoot the first <em>Avatar</em> in 3D, but since most of the actors were digitally captured, he also had the freedom to construct scenes with a virtual camera after they were physically shot. For <a class=""link"" href=""https://www.engadget.com/avatar-the-way-of-water-review-hfr-high-frame-rate-170058030.html"" target=""_blank""><em>Avatar: The Way of Water</em></a>, which arrived a whopping 13 years after the first film, Cameron also leaned into high frame rate footage and new ways of modeling natural fluid dynamics.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though the third entry, <em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em>, is coming just a few years after the last sequel, I still expected Cameron to deliver some sort of new feat to wow audiences. He could have found a smoother way to employ high frame rate footage, so the film wasn't jarringly shifting between traditional 24 fps scenes and smoother 48 fps action shots. Maybe we'd see more natural interactions between live actors and virtual characters and environments (it sure is hard to beat <a class=""link"" href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsIDoazDoaI"" target=""_blank"">Edie Falco suited up in a wicked exoskeleton</a> in the last film, though). </p><p>Instead, <em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em> is just another <em>Avatar</em> film — it doesn't push any boundaries, narratively or technically. And without any technical achievements to lean on, the narrative issues inherent with <em>Avatar</em> become all the more glaring.&nbsp;</p><div><div style=""width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;""></div></div><p>It's still basically a story that places a clueless white dude in the middle of a fight between indigenous and colonialist powers. (Improbably, he's crowned one of the Na'vi's best warriors!). The script from Cameron and his co-writers (Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, continuing their work from <em>The Way of Water</em>) often hits identical beats to a low-rent CW show. And perhaps worst of all, the stakes of the story haven't really changed much. Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and his family are still fighting off the militarized Resource Development Association (RDA), Col. Quaritch still holds a grudge from being killed (twice now!) and from the Sullies raising his Tarzan-like son, Spider (Jack Champion).</p><p>There’s an attempt to cast the Na’vi in a new light with the villainous Ash People, who spend their days attacking and stealing from other tribes. While most Na’vi people work cooperatively with other clans and share their reverence for Eywa, the collective consciousness of Pandora, the Ash People resent it for not saving their villages from natural disasters. Despite a deliciously evil performance by Oona Chaplin (Charlie Chaplin's grandaughter!) as Varang, the Ash People don't amount to much more than &quot;evil Na'vi.&quot; When they inevitably work together with humans to attack other Na’vi, it doesn’t feel surprising in the least. Honestly, it’s a tad insulting.</p><figure><img alt=""Avatar: Fire and Ash"" src=""https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/3248B_0010_v0800.le.1131.jpg"" style=""height: 1080px; width: 2048px;"" /><figcaption>Avatar: Fire and Ash</figcaption><div class=""photo-credit"">20th. Century Studios</div></figure><p>Perhaps we've been spoiled by Cameron's last few films, but <em>Avatar: Fire and Ash </em>ultimately feels like more of the same. Even its massive final battle feels like a retread, since it’s set in the same ocean environment as <em>The Way of Water</em> and is once again focused on protecting psychic alien whales from humans. Cameron does let his action chops shine throughout the film, but after a certain point, trying to enjoy those sequences is like trying to eat a family-sized carton of ice cream by yourself. You’ll enjoy it for a little while, but eventually you’re&nbsp; left with a massive headache and sugar hangover.</p><p>It’s clear that James Cameron has built the Avatar franchise to explore everything he loves: Stories about protecting the environment, fighting against capitalist excess and kicking tons of ass. Parts of<em> Avatar 4</em> have already been shot, and that film is expected to arrive in 2029. But I’m hoping the 71-year-old filmmaker eventually finds his way out of Pandora. He’s co-directing the Billie Eilish concert film, <em>Hit Me Hard and Soft: The Tour</em>, so that’s a start. But I’m eager to see what other new worlds he can dream up. </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/avatar-fire-and-ash-review-maybe-its-time-to-sunset-pandora-140000997.html?src=rss",Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics,TECH
"Tue, 16 Dec 2025 14:00:00 +0000",Mercedes-Benz CLA first drive: Head of the EV class,"<p>This one's been a long time coming. Mercedes-Benz has been researching, refining and even reshaping the car that would ultimately be the CLA for years now, teasing us with technical briefings and even showing off a sultry crimson concept car a full two years ago.</p><p>That was the <a class=""link"" href=""https://www.engadget.com/the-mercedes-benz-concept-cla-class-mixes-big-range-and-big-style-130222801.html"" target=""_blank"">Concept CLA</a>, and while the production CLA you see here doesn't look quite that good, it is a fine-looking little electric sedan. More importantly, it goes as far as you'd think its slippery, 0.21-coefficient-of-drag body would carry it: up to 374 miles on a charge.</p><p>With a $47,250 starting price, is this electric CLA the complete package? After spending a day behind the wheel of one, I think it might just be.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=""a05223a6-5a8b-4561-ac84-7ae81b011361"">Higher density</h2><figure><img alt=""2026 Mercedes-Benz CLA 250+ EQ"" src=""https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_Mercedes-Benz_CLA_EQ_first_drive_012.jpg"" style=""height: 1707px; width: 2560px;"" /><figcaption>2026 Mercedes-Benz CLA 250+ EQ</figcaption><div class=""photo-credit"">Tim Stevens for Engadget</div></figure><p>The CLA has long been Mercedes-Benz's most attainable sedan, a machine for those wanting something fun and stylish that offers a taste of the M-B lifestyle without breaking the bank.Attainability is still a big focus of this newly rebooted CLA, which serves as the debut venue for the company's latest generation of electrification. While most luxury auto makers would have you swing for their top-tier models to get the newest tech, Mercedes is actually bringing it to the lower end first.&nbsp;</p><p>The new CLA is built around a new battery pack that offers 20 percent more energy density than the company's previous EVs. There's a big boost in efficiency, too. Where the EQS, the company's current range meister, does up to 390 miles on a charge from roughly 110 kilowatt-hours, the CLA manages 374 miles from just 85. It's a much smaller car, sure, and lighter too at about 4,500 pounds versus 5,500 and up for the EQS, but there are bigger efficiencies at play here thanks to advanced motors and the aforementioned aerodynamics.</p><p>The CLA’s&nbsp; 0.21 coefficient of drag slots it right in between the 0.20 rating for the EQS sedan and 0.22 for the EQE. Crucially, though, despite being just as slippery as those cars, Mercedes-Benz's designers also managed to make the CLS stylish, a big step up from the efficient but amorphous profiles of its previous EVs.&nbsp;</p><p>That aerodynamic efficiency is a big part of what delivers the 374-mile range for the single-motor CLA 250+ with EQ Technology model, the formal and long-winded designation for what I drove. It delivers 268 horsepower through the rear wheels. Those wanting a bit more oomph can step up to the 349-hp, dual-motor, all-wheel-drive 350 4MATIC model. That extra power and low-grip surety costs an extra $2,550, but the bigger penalty is range: the dual-motor model maxes out at 312 miles on a charge. (There is a hybrid version of the new CLA coming as well, but we'll cover that on its own later.)</p><p>When it comes to charging, the new CLA impresses there, too. Charging at up to 320 kilowatts via the company's first <a class=""link"" href=""https://www.engadget.com/tesla-has-won-the-ev-charging-wars-155726724.html"" target=""_blank"">NACS plug</a>, the CLA adds a whopping 200 miles of range in 10 minutes. Weirdly, the car also has a separate, older-style J1772 plug for slower, level-two charging.</p><h2 id=""0171fd46-aa93-4770-8594-08b2d7ec0e0c"">Accessible, not basic</h2><figure><img alt=""The interior displays of the 2026 Mercedes-Benz CLA 250+ EQ"" src=""https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_Mercedes-Benz_CLA_EQ_first_drive_064.jpg"" style=""height: 1707px; width: 2560px;"" /><figcaption>The interior displays of the 2026 Mercedes-Benz CLA 250+ EQ</figcaption><div class=""photo-credit"">Tim Stevens for Engadget</div></figure><p>As a more attainable machine, you wouldn't necessarily expect the CLA to be completely loaded with features. Still, tick enough boxes and you can definitely get it there. While it doesn't have the luscious, curving <a class=""link"" href=""https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-mbux-hyperscreen-eqs-161520472.html"" target=""_blank"">Hyperscreen</a> display as the EQS, it does offer a similar experience called Superscreen. You can get up to three displays spread across the dashboard: a 10.25-inch gauge cluster on the left, a 14-inch touchscreen in the center and an optional third display (also 14 inches) on the right for the passenger to play <em>Angry Birds</em> or stream videos. If, for some reason, they wouldn't rather just look at their phone.</p><p>All those displays run the latest version of the MBUX user interface, similar to what we've seen in the company's other EVs, but it’s a bit simpler and easier to use here. That's backed by a wholly new system-level operating system called <a class=""link"" href=""http://mb.os"" target=""_blank"">MB.OS</a> running on NVIDIA silicon, also making its debut on the CLA. Mercedes says this not only has far more capability but can also be more comprehensively updated via the car's 5G connection.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the features in the latest Mercedes software is baked-in AI. Say &quot;Hey, Mercedes,&quot; and you can not only change just about any setting in the car, but also engage in any number of inane conversations. I asked for a weather update for my next trip to Chicago, the latest releases from a few of my forgotten bands and even got an explanation of why the lyrics in the song &quot;Water's Edge&quot; by Seven Mary Three are so very creepy. (Don't go down there, friends.)</p><p>It's all reasonably snappy and quite useful, but not perfect. When I said &quot;I'm hungry,&quot; I got a quick listing of restaurants and offers for quick routing. When I said, &quot;I need a hospital,&quot; the system, flummoxed, just stopped talking to me. Thankfully, I did not need a hospital. I was actually feeling pretty okay.&nbsp;</p><p>That extensive software upgradability is also opening the door to a new era of car upgrades. Yes, the automotive DLC era is here, and you can pay extra to unlock additional active features like automated parking, navigation, a dashcam function and whatever else Mercedes-Benz's product planners can dream up in the future. Hopefully, there's <a class=""link"" href=""https://www.engadget.com/2006-04-03-download-oblivions-horse-armor-for-a-price.html"" target=""_blank"">no horse armor involved</a>.</p><p>We'll see how that shakes out, but my only real complaint about the interior was that it felt a bit cramped. It's a sedan on the small side, sure, but the layout feels a bit claustrophobic. That dashboard with all the displays is situated nearly vertically, as are the sides of the center console. Sitting in the passenger seat felt like being tucked in a box.</p><p>Mind you, it was a very comfortable box, well-upholstered and featuring a lovely interior trim made of recycled paper, grooved to give the effect of a Zen garden. Headroom up front is generous and actually isn't too bad in the rear, but ducking under that sweeping roofline to get into the back seats requires a bit of flexibility.</p><h2 id=""13bd0547-dcf5-42e3-83f0-207c950c103b"">Drive time</h2><figure><img alt=""2026 Mercedes-Benz CLA 250+ EQ"" src=""https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_Mercedes-Benz_CLA_EQ_first_drive_022.jpg"" style=""height: 1707px; width: 2560px;"" /><figcaption>2026 Mercedes-Benz CLA 250+ EQ</figcaption><div class=""photo-credit"">Tim Stevens for Engadget</div></figure><p>Despite being the slowest electric CLA, this little sedan gets off the line quickly. A 6.6-second 0-to-60 time under-sells the feeling of instant acceleration and throttle response that make EVs so very compelling. You only start to feel the CLA's relative lack of horsepower at higher speeds, but even there, it's hardly lacking.</p><p>That made it a blast to scoot from light to light as I was escaping from San Francisco, but it was much more fun in the foothills of Mt. Tamalpais. The CLA's steering is light yet has good feedback. I could really feel the road beneath the front tires, making for a more engaging machine than I was expecting.</p><p>That battery pack in the floor keeps body roll in check, but a positively pliant suspension makes for a relaxed affair. The CLA did a great job of soaking up the countless imperfections in and around San Francisco, making for an extremely comfortable commuter, if one that felt a bit floaty at times.</p><p>It'll be a safe commuter, too. The car is festooned with sensors, including 10 cameras of various resolutions and focal lengths, five radar sensors firing in every direction and 12 ultrasonic sensors. You'll need to pay extra for the digital keys to unlock their full functionality, though, like advanced lane-keeping and automated lane changes. There's even an advanced, point-to-point driver assistance system coming called <a class=""link"" href=""http://MB.DRIVE"" target=""_blank""></a><a class=""link"" target=""_blank"">MB.DRIVE</a> Assist Pro that'll let the car handle most of the steering — even on secondary roads. More details on that to come.&nbsp;</p><p>For now, the car did great at managing itself on the highway, changing lanes with enough initiative to get through commuter traffic without issue, and not only bringing itself to a complete stop in traffic, but resuming again as soon as the cars ahead moved.</p><p>It even delivered good efficiency. I saw 3.9 miles per kWh, which would equate to a theoretical 331 miles from the 85 kWh battery pack. That's despite my driving with a good amount of enthusiasm and a heavy right foot. <em>Edmunds</em>, driving more conservatively, got <a class=""link rapid-with-clickid"" href=""https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=6a686c6e-b7e2-4710-a51c-d3aa72b17ad0&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=23ce3709-a8ec-4bef-b82f-2be57c151008&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Edmunds&amp;linkText=434+miles+from+a+single+charge&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5lZG11bmRzLmNvbS9jYXItbmV3cy8yMDI2LW1lcmNlZGVzLWJlbnotY2xhLWV2LXJhbmdlLWNoYXJnaW5nLXRlc3QtZmVhdHVyZS5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyM2NlMzcwOS1hOGVjLTRiZWYtYjgyZi0yYmU1N2MxNTEwMDgiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkbXVuZHMuY29tL2Nhci1uZXdzLzIwMjYtbWVyY2VkZXMtYmVuei1jbGEtZXYtcmFuZ2UtY2hhcmdpbmctdGVzdC1mZWF0dXJlLmh0bWwifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWIh1g8na2dv-Mzn53QZW6p947qQKFtSu4br1sDI03Rr&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.edmunds.com%2Fcar-news%2F2026-mercedes-benz-cla-ev-range-charging-test-feature.html"" target=""_blank"">434 miles from a single charge</a>,</p><h2 id=""7333da33-b44c-4ec0-8b79-92a58530b980"">Wrap-up</h2><figure><img alt=""2026 Mercedes-Benz CLA 250+ EQ"" src=""https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/2026_Mercedes-Benz_CLA_EQ_first_drive_047.jpg"" style=""height: 1707px; width: 2560px;"" /><figcaption>2026 Mercedes-Benz CLA 250+ EQ</figcaption><div class=""photo-credit"">Tim Stevens for Engadget</div></figure><p>So the CLA looks great, drives well, has plenty of range and again, starting at $47,250, feels well-priced.

However, while other video game adaptations like <em>The Last of Us</em> suffered from a bit of a <a class=""link"" href=""https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/the-last-of-us-season-two-review-more-zombies-and-more-heartbreak-160007479.html"" target=""_blank"">sophomore slump</a>, <em>Fallout </em>continues to get more crass, vulgar and abrasive in the most entertaining ways.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Editor's note: We were provided the first six of eight episodes of Fallout season 2 for this review, so if the ending of this season misses its landing, blame The Enclave.&nbsp;</em></p><p>Season two picks up directly after the first as Lucy (played by Ella Purnelle) and The Ghoul (Walton Goggins) make their way across the wasteland in pursuit of Lucy's father. And right away, we're instantly reminded of the magnetic chemistry between our leading lady vault dweller and her endearing naivete and our post-apocalyptic cowboy afflicted with dark pragmatism from having simply lived through too much. This simple combo not only often provides the setup for Lucy's signature catchphrase — which is both quaint and refreshing — it also sets the stage for some interesting plot points. Just hearing The Ghoul say things like &quot;Do more drugs&quot; with Goggin's classic drawl and without a hint of irony is a real treat.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt=""There's never a dull moment when Lucy and The Ghoul are traveling together.

That's because unlike the <em>Fallout</em> games where you get to steer the action, we're just here for the ride as we flip between Lucy's search for her father, the existential crises facing multiple vaults and an expanded role for Maximus (Aaron Moten) as he suddenly finds himself near the top of the Brotherhood of Steel's org chart.&nbsp;</p><p>But somehow, the showrunners have managed to make each branching path just as engaging as the others. There were hints of his range in the first season, but Moises Arias shines as Lucy's brother Norm as the leader of a new crew (I'm trying to keep this review as spoiler-free as possible) while Annabel O'Hagan as Overseer Harper does a fantastic job of switching between being out of her depth and completely unhinged at a moment's notice.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt=""In season two, it feels like Aaron Moten's Maximus is so close to figuring out what kind of soldier he wants to be.

In some ways, it's the continuation of someone defining their own morality, which rarely feels as convincing or driven as someone with a plan. But there's still intrigue there too.</p><p>Meanwhile, for fans of the games, the number of easter eggs and callbacks is downright delightful. The set design and cinematography make the wasteland a character in its own right, even if the last thing I want to see is someone eat flea soup. We're also treated to an ever-growing zoography of nuclear critters such as rad scorpions, all sorts of mutants and more, along with appearances from iconic characters like everyone's favorite <a class=""link"" href=""https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Victor_(Fallout:_New_Vegas)"" target=""_blank"">cowboy-coded security robot</a>. And I appreciate how the show spends a little extra time to go over the myriad of factions (like The Legion and the NCR), which pays homage to the core series while functioning as an interesting side quest at the same time.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt=""With Overseer Harper at the helm, there's no telling what will happen to Vault 32. "" src=""https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/FalloutS2TBimage7_3000.jpg"" style=""height: 2000px; width: 3000px;"" /><figcaption>With Overseer Harper at the helm, there's no telling what will happen to Vault 32. </figcaption><div class=""photo-credit"">Prime Video</div></figure><p>With this much going on, it would be easy for a series to become overburdened. But the pacing isn't labored, because while the show doesn't actually get to New Vegas until episode four, the journey there was so entertaining that I didn't mind. Perhaps most importantly, even though it would be impossible to completely recreate <em>New Vegas</em> on TV (since you can’t choose your own adventure here like you can in the game), it really feels like <em>Fallout's </em>showrunners have nailed the balance between respecting the source material and tweaking the story to fit a different medium.&nbsp;</p><p>That's a big credit to the franchise, especially coming from a genre that often gets maligned for a lack of depth or nuance. But it's also a tribute to this series, which continues to be a prime example of how to make the jump from pixels to TV screens look gook. And after seeing <em>The Last of Us</em> stumble a bit during its second cour, I might even go so far as to say that <em>Fallout</em> is the best live-action video game crossover to date.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/fallout-season-2-review-viva-new-vegas-140000678.html?src=rss",Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics,TECH
"Tue, 16 Dec 2025 13:45:48 +0000",China approves two level-3 autonomous EVs,"<p>China has taken another step forward in the self-driving car market. The country's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has <a href=""https://www.miit.gov.cn/xwfb/gxdt/sjdt/art/2025/art_f734c7074580470593d4018742997640.html"">made its first approval</a> for cars with level-3 autonomous driving capabilities. The two electric sedans come from state-owned automakers Changan Auto and BAIC Motor.</p>
<p>The US National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) <a href=""https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle-safety/automated-vehicles-safety"">defines level-3 driving</a> as &quot;the system handles all aspects of the driving task while you, as the driver, are available to take over driving if requested. If the system can no longer operate and prompts the driver, the driver must be available to resume all aspects of the driving task.&quot;</p>
<span id=""end-legacy-contents""></span><p>According to a translation of MIIT's announcement, the Changan vehicle can drive autonomously in single lanes of both highways and urban expressways in traffic congestion. It is allowed solely in certain areas of  Chongqing at a maximum speed of 50 km/h (31 mph). The BAIC electric sedan can also function autonomously on the same roads, but only in areas of Beijing at a maximum speed of 80 km/h (50 mph).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;The team strictly followed the standards and procedures to conduct preliminary review, selection, testing, and safety assessments,&quot; MIIT stated. &quot;Both automotive companies have completed and passed the product testing and safety assessments as required.&quot; They didn't present a timeline for when the models would become available.&nbsp;</p>

The AirPods Pro 3, which came out in September, are currently down to $210. That's $40 off and only $10 more than the record-low price we saw last week. The Pro 3s have been fluctuating in price since Black Friday, with the lowest they've been being $199 for a brief period. With the new AirPods Pro, Apple made some big improvements, including better battery life and sound quality, and introduced useful new features, such as Live Translation.</p>

<p>The AirPods Pro 3 are <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-airpods-100041810.html"">the best AirPods</a> available today, with Apple's H2 chip, and earned a score of 90 out of 100 in <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-review-a-significant-update-to-apples-best-earbuds-120028170.html"">Engadget's review</a> this fall. Active noise cancellation (ANC) is one of the biggest selling points of the AirPods Pro, and Apple has made the experience even better with the AirPods Pro 3. They sport new foam-infused ear tips that create a better seal to improve passive noise isolation, and as Engadget's Billy Steele wrote in his review, &quot;Ultra-low-noise microphones combine with advanced computational audio to silence even more background noise.&quot; In testing, they had no problem blocking out the chatter of people nearby or otherwise noisy environments.</p> <span id=""end-legacy-contents""></span>
<p>With the AirPods Pro 3, Apple introduced heart-rate sensing, so you'll be able to see your heart rate data from the earbuds in the Fitness app and other workout apps. The AirPods Pro 3 also boast Live Translation, which you can activate via controls on the earbuds themselves. As long as you have an Apple Intelligence-capable device, you'll be able to translate in-person conversations in English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish and Chinese (Mandarin).</p>

<p>The DLC will include &quot;new areas, bosses, tools and more,&quot; the developer wrote. There aren't a lot of clues to the gameplay in the short trailer below, but the four shots definitely relay the vibe. The first shows what looks like fishing tackle, then we see something (or someone) on a tomb-like wooden platform tied under a canvas sheet. Next an orb-like structure crackling with electricity looms and finally the game's protagonist, Hornet, appears.&nbsp;</p>

"Tue, 16 Dec 2025 12:30:00 +0000",The Anker Laptop Power Bank soothed my (self-inflicted) battery anxiety,"<p>For the longest time, I refused to upgrade my work-issued MacBook. I was leery of the hassle, and would much rather hang on to an aging Intel-powered laptop than have to transfer files, set up apps and sign in to accounts all over again. What did it matter if my notebook barely lasted long enough to cover an iPhone launch? My petty brain blamed it all on external factors (like being forced to use a MacBook instead of a PC), and left me dripping in stress as I watched the power levels dip down to zero at many of the live events I attend every year. So when I saw the <a class=""link rapid-with-clickid"" href=""https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0DCBB2YTR&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=f60d172b-bdff-4823-ba90-d510d97102f6&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Anker+Laptop+Power+Bank&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRENCQjJZVFI_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZjYwZDE3MmItYmRmZi00ODIzLWJhOTAtZDUxMGQ5NzEwMmY2Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRENCQjJZVFIiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWvAradhSm37fVZQjKe0UfTC2cW_0PPGtUP9BrLy72ay&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DCBB2YTR"" target=""_blank"">Anker Laptop Power Bank</a> was one of the items in our Labor Day deals roundup this year, I decided to get one to alleviate my battery anxiety (instead of, you know, doing the sane thing and agreeing to a new laptop).</p>
<p>When I unboxed my new <a class=""link"" href=""https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/anker-laptop-power-bank-review-all-my-favorite-battery-features-together-at-last-130036854.html"" target=""_blank"">Laptop Power Bank</a> the night before <a class=""link"" href=""https://www.engadget.com/apple-event-2025-live-updates-as-iphone-17-new-watches-airpods-pro-3-and-more-are-unveiled-100023813.html"" target=""_blank"">the iPhone 17 Pro launch</a>, I wasn’t expecting to be so taken by its features. All I knew before then was that this was a solid, beefy laptop battery pack, squeezing 25,000mAh in a compact package that would save me from having to worry too much about finding an outlet. But when I saw the screen light up with details on the amount of energy left (to two decimal places!) and the real-time charge data when I plugged it in, I was impressed. How modern!</p>
<p>Then I noticed the built-in cables — one retractable and neatly tucked inside the charger and the other artfully curved into a groove and doubling as a handle. Both wires were braided and felt like they’d be resistant to fraying and destroying themselves over time. Altogether, the general build quality and functionality of all the components made it clear this was a thoughtfully designed product worthy of all the praise and money we’ve hurled at it since my colleagues first tested it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But what truly made me smile (and giggle, honestly) was a naughty little <a class=""link"" href=""https://www.tiktok.com/discover/anker-power-bank-face-easter-egg"" target=""_blank"">Easter egg</a>. I saw posts on Threads indicating that if you tugged on that retractable cable and let it go in and out a few times, the screen would show a smiley face. I didn’t believe this was true until I saw it for myself. Sure, it felt a little bit odd, but I told myself I was revving a chainsaw, and doing legitimate testing for professional reasons, not jerking off a device. And when I saw the funny face appear, I felt the effect was humorous rather than pervy. The good news for the more staid readers is that if you don’t want to ever see that face, you never have to. And if you like cheeky little touches in your tech products, the Anker Laptop Battery Charger will delight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regardless of how I felt about having pleasured a laptop battery charger, it doesn’t take away from the fact that this is a well-made, well-rounded product. It managed to get my MacBook a few extra hours, so I made it all the way to the end of a multi-hour keynote, though it did run completely empty so I couldn’t recharge my phone after. Blast Apple Park and its utter lack of available power outlets!</p>
<p>Anker’s Laptop Battery Pack effectively allayed my battery anxiety, brought me some mirth and won me over with its thoughtful design. And because I got it on sale, it was $90 well spent.</p>

"Tue, 16 Dec 2025 12:15:47 +0000",The Morning After: Roomba maker iRobot files for bankruptcy,"<p>iRobot, the company that brought robotic vacuum cleaners to homes and popular culture, has filed for  <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/home/irobot-has-filed-for-bankruptcy-and-may-be-taken-over-by-its-primary-supplier-091602257.html"">bankruptcy</a>. It plans to sell all assets to its primary supplier, the Chinese company Picea Robotics. Investors “will experience a total loss and not receive recovery on their investment” if the deal is approved, iRobot said. The company didn’t discuss how the move might affect its employees in the US or elsewhere.</p>
<p>Amazon dropped its $1.7 billion acquisition of the company last year after a veto threat from European regulators, leaving the Roomba maker with no other option. Political scrutiny came on two fronts: The company was also reportedly hit hard by Trump’s tariffs in Vietnam, where it manufactures products for the US market.</p>
<p>iRobot launched its first Roomba in 2002, arguably inventing the world of robot vacuums — and the first robots to enter many of our homes. Competition from rivals has chipped away at its dominance, with other companies coming in at both lower and higher prices, like Roborock, Dyson and Anker’s Eufy.</p>

"Tue, 16 Dec 2025 10:01:25 +0000",The best mobile microphones for 2026,"<p>There’s nothing more frustrating than shooting the perfect reel only to realize that the audio sounds like garbage. For budding creators, it’s a frustration; for those looking to make more professional content, it’s a dealbreaker. Fortunately, the world of mobile-specific (or phone-friendly) microphones has exploded with great options in the last few years. Whether you’ve been tasked with recording candid moments at a relative’s wedding, shooting a friend’s dance moves or are a journalist out in the field traveling light — there’s an option out there that will be perfect for you.<br /><br />We’ve tested a wide range of popular microphones with a mobile focus so that you don’t have to. Below is our hand-picked list of the very best options for a variety of use cases. Some microphones — the wireless lavalier kind, for example — will be more versatile and convenient, useful for a number of different applications. Others, such as our musician or field-recording picks, are where we explore more exotic form factors such as shotgun mics and mobile-friendly desktop options. As always, above everything else is sound quality and general performance. The good news for you is that we’ve done all the hard work for you. Happy recording!</p> 
<h2 id=""jump-link-best-phone-mics-for-2026-best-wireless-mics-for-creators"">Best phone mics for 2026: Best wireless mics for creators</h2> 
<p>“Creator” is a broad term, but for the purposes of this guide, it’s anyone that wants to make videos or recordings to share on the internet. This is possibly the most exciting category right now with excellent options from brands such as Rode and DJI, but also some compelling budget options too. Once the domain of TV and pro productions, wireless lavalier mics are now the go-to choice for anyone creating in front of (or even behind) the camera. They usually sound great, offer hands-free flexibility and premium models come with extra features that will streamline your creative process.</p> <span id=""end-legacy-contents""></span>

<h2 id=""jump-link-how-we-test-mobile-microphones"">How we test mobile microphones</h2> 
<p>The world of mobile microphones has exploded in recent years thanks to affordable, high-quality wireless systems, the popularity of social media and content creation and, of course, Apple’s reluctant switch to USB-C on the iPhone which has removed connectivity complications for manufacturers.</p> 
<p>When it comes to testing, my experience as a journalist, podcast producer, YouTuber and (failing) music producer has given me a lot of real-world experience with a wide variety of products all aimed at different jobs. When compiling this guide for Engadget, I filter that experience down to a few simple criteria that allows us to focus on what’s important to you, the reader and whatever it is you’re trying to record.</p> 
<p>The main criteria for mobile microphones are simple: Does it sound great? Does it connect to a phone directly and reliably? And, is it good value for its intended purpose? A hobbyist and a professional have different budgets after all.</p> 
<p>What <em>every</em> microphone endures is repeated recording in treated, non-treated and outdoor environments. I’ll also A/B test each one against its rivals and usually a suitable reference microphone — Shure’s SM7b for podcasting microphones or Rode’s NTG 5 for shotgun/video mics, for example.</p> 
<p>Some sub-categories of microphone require a slightly different approach. For wireless systems, I test how far I can walk from the receiver before recordings degrade, along with a standard battery life test by setting them to record until they power off. For podcast and vocal-focused microphones, I record in different spaces to see how they cope with different environments and measure self noise (recording “silence”). Lastly, I test how they sound when recording at different distances from the microphone.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-mobile-microphones-for-recording-with-a-phone-154536629.html?src=rss",Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics,TECH

"Wed, 17 Dec 2025 19:00:00 GMT",JP Morgan’s AI adoption hit 50% of employees. The secret? A connectivity-first architecture,"<p>When Derek Waldron and his technical team at <a href=""https://www.jpmorganchase.com/"">JPMorgan Chase</a> first launched an LLM suite with personal assistants two-and-a-half years ago, they weren’t sure what to expect. That wasn’t long after the game-changing emergence of ChatGPT, but in enterprise, skepticism was still high. </p><p>Surprisingly, employees opted into the internal platform organically — and quickly. Within months, usage jumped from zero to 250,000 employees. Now, more than 60% of employees across sales, finance, technology, operations, and other departments use the continually evolving, continually connected suite.</p><p>“We were surprised by just how viral it was,” Waldron, JPMorgan’s chief analytics officer, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxJzeRGzV8"">explains in a new VB Beyond the Pilot podcast</a>. Employees weren’t just designing prompts, they were building and customizing assistants with specific personas, instructions, and roles and were sharing their learnings on internal platforms. </p><div></div><p></p><p>The financial giant has pulled off what most enterprises still struggle to achieve: large-scale, voluntary employee adoption of AI. It wasn’t the result of mandates; rather, early adopters shared tangible use cases, and workers began feeding off each other’s enthusiasm. This bottom-up usage has ultimately resulted in an innovation flywheel. </p><p>“It’s this deep rooted innovative population,” Waldron says. “If we can continue to equip them with really easy to use, powerful capabilities, they can turbocharge the next evolution of this journey.” </p><div></div><h3>Ubiquitous connectivity plugged into highly sophisticated systems of record</h3><p>JPMorgan has taken a rare, forward-looking approach to its technical architecture. The company treats AI as a core infrastructure rather than a novelty, operating from the early contrarian stance that the models themselves would become a commodity. Instead, they identified the connectivity around the system as the real challenge and defensible moat.</p><p>The financial giant invested early in multimodal <a href=""https://venturebeat.com/ai/does-rag-make-llms-less-safe-bloomberg-research-reveals-hidden-dangers"">retrieval-augmented generation</a> (RAG), now in its fourth generation and incorporating multi-modality. Its AI suite is hosted at the center of an enterprise-wide platform equipped with connectors and tools that support analysis and preparation. </p><p>Employees can plug into an expanding ecosystem of critical business data and interact with “very sophisticated” documents, knowledge and structured data stores, as well as CRM, HR, trading, finance and risk systems. Waldron says his team continues to add more connections by the month. </p><p>“We built the platform around this type of ubiquitous connectivity,” he explains. Ultimately, AI is a great general-purpose technology that will only grow more powerful, but if people don’t have meaningful access and critical use cases, “you&#x27;re squandering the opportunity.” </p><p>As Waldron puts it, AI’s capabilities continue to grow impressively — but they simply remain shiny objects for show if they can’t prove real-world use. </p><p>“Even if super intelligence were to show up tomorrow, there&#x27;s no value that can be optimally extracted if that superintelligence can&#x27;t connect into the systems, the data, the tools, the knowledge, the processes that exist within the enterprise,” he contends. </p><p><b>Listen to the </b><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxJzeRGzV8""><b>full episode</b></a><b> to hear about: </b></p><ul><li><p><b>Waldron’s personal strategy of pausing before asking a human colleague</b> and instead assessing how his AI assistant could answer that question and solve the problem. </p></li><li><p><b>A &quot;one platform, many jobs&quot; approach:</b> No two roles are the same way, so strategy should center on reusable building blocks (RAG, document intelligence, structured data querying) that employees can assemble into role-specific tools.</p></li><li><p><b>Why RAG maturity matters:</b> JPMorgan evolved through multiple generations of retrieval — from basic vector search to hierarchical, authoritative, multimodal knowledge pipelines.</p></li></ul><p>Subscribe to Beyond the Pilot on <a href=""https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/venturebeat/id1839285239"">Apple Podcasts</a> and <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/show/4Zti73yb4hmiTNa7pEYls4"">Spotify</a>. </p>",VentureBeat,TECH
"Wed, 17 Dec 2025 14:00:00 GMT",AI agents fail 63% of the time on complex tasks. Patronus AI says its new 'living' training worlds can fix that.,"<p><a href=""https://www.patronus.ai/"">Patronus AI</a>, the artificial intelligence evaluation startup backed by <a href=""https://siliconangle.com/2025/05/14/patronus-ai-debuts-new-percival-tool-fixing-ai-agent-malfunctions/"">$20 million</a> from investors including <a href=""https://lsvp.com/"">Lightspeed Venture Partners</a> and <a href=""https://www.datadoghq.com/"">Datadog</a>, unveiled a new training architecture Tuesday that it says represents a fundamental shift in how AI agents learn to perform complex tasks.</p><p>The technology, which the company calls &quot;<a href=""https://www.patronus.ai/rl-environments"">Generative Simulators</a>,&quot; creates adaptive simulation environments that continuously generate new challenges, update rules dynamically, and evaluate an agent&#x27;s performance as it learns — all in real time. The approach marks a departure from the static benchmarks that have long served as the industry standard for measuring AI capabilities but have increasingly come under fire for failing to predict real-world performance.</p><p>&quot;Traditional benchmarks measure isolated capabilities, but they miss the interruptions, context switches, and layered decision-making that define real work,&quot; said Anand Kannappan, chief executive and co-founder of Patronus AI, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. &quot;For agents to perform at human levels, they need to learn the way humans do—through dynamic experience and continuous feedback.&quot;</p><p>The announcement arrives at a critical moment for the AI industry. AI agents are reshaping software development, from writing code to carrying out complex instructions. Yet LLM-based agents are prone to errors and often perform poorly on complicated, multi-step tasks. Research published earlier this year found that an agent with just a <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-agents-errors-hallucinations-compound-risk-2025-4"">1% error rate per step</a> can compound to a 63% chance of failure by the hundredth step — a sobering statistic for enterprises seeking to deploy autonomous AI systems at scale.</p><h2><b>Why static AI benchmarks are failing — and what comes next</b></h2><p>Patronus AI&#x27;s approach addresses what the company describes as a growing mismatch between how AI systems are evaluated and how they actually perform in production. Traditional benchmarks, the company argues, function like standardized tests: they measure specific capabilities at a fixed point in time but struggle to capture the messy, unpredictable nature of real work.</p><p>The new <a href=""https://www.patronus.ai/rl-environments"">Generative Simulators</a> architecture flips this model. Rather than presenting agents with a fixed set of questions, the system generates assignments, environmental conditions, and oversight processes on the fly, then adapts based on how the agent behaves.</p><p>&quot;Over the past year, we&#x27;ve seen a shift away from traditional static benchmarks toward more interactive learning grounds,&quot; Rebecca Qian, chief technology officer and co-founder of Patronus AI, told VentureBeat. &quot;This is partly because of the innovation we&#x27;ve seen from model developers — the shift toward reinforcement learning, post-training, and continual learning, and away from supervised instruction tuning. What that means is there&#x27;s been a collapse in the distinction between training and evaluation. Benchmarks have become environments.&quot;</p><p>The technology builds on reinforcement learning — an approach where AI systems learn through trial and error, receiving rewards for correct actions and penalties for mistakes. Reinforcement learning is an approach where AI systems learn to make optimal decisions by receiving rewards or penalties for their actions, improving through trial and error. RL can help agents improve, but it typically requires developers to extensively rewrite their code. This discourages adoption, even though the data these agents generate could significantly boost performance through RL training.</p><p>Patronus AI also introduced a new concept it calls &quot;<a href=""https://www.patronus.ai/"">Open Recursive Self-Improvement</a>,&quot; or ORSI — environments where agents can continuously improve through interaction and feedback without requiring a complete retraining cycle between attempts. The company positions this as critical infrastructure for developing AI systems capable of learning continuously rather than being frozen at a point in time.</p><h2><b>Inside the &#x27;Goldilocks Zone&#x27;: How adaptive AI training finds the sweet spot</b></h2><p>At the heart of <a href=""https://www.patronus.ai/"">Generative Simulators</a> lies what Patronus AI calls a &quot;curriculum adjuster&quot; — a component that analyzes agent behavior and dynamically modifies the difficulty and nature of training scenarios. The approach draws inspiration from how effective human teachers adapt their instruction based on student performance.</p><p>Qian explained the approach using an analogy: &quot;You can think of this as a teacher-student model, where we&#x27;re training the model and the professor continually adapts the curriculum.&quot;</p><p>This adaptive approach addresses a problem that Kannappan described as finding the &quot;Goldilocks Zone&quot; in training data — ensuring that examples are neither too easy nor too hard for a given model to learn from effectively.</p><p>&quot;What&#x27;s important is not just whether you can train on a data set, but whether you can train on a high-quality data set that&#x27;s tuned to your model—one it can actually learn from,&quot; Kannappan said. &quot;We want to make sure the examples aren&#x27;t too hard for the model, nor too easy.&quot;</p><p>The company says initial results show meaningful improvements in agent performance. Training on Patronus AI&#x27;s environments has increased task completion rates by 10% to 20% across real-world tasks including software engineering, customer service, and financial analysis, according to the company.</p><h2><b>The AI cheating problem: How &#x27;moving target&#x27; environments prevent reward hacking</b></h2><p>One of the most persistent challenges in training AI agents through reinforcement learning is a phenomenon researchers call &quot;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reward_hacking"">reward hacking</a>&quot;—where systems learn to exploit loopholes in their training environment rather than genuinely solving problems. Famous examples include early agents that learned to hide in corners of video games rather than actually play them.</p><p>Generative Simulators addresses this by making the training environment itself a moving target.</p><p>&quot;Reward hacking is fundamentally a problem when systems are static. It&#x27;s like students learning to cheat on a test,&quot; Qian said. &quot;But when we&#x27;re continually evolving the environment, we can actually look at parts of the system that need to adapt and evolve. Static benchmarks are fixed targets; generative simulator environments are moving targets.&quot;</p><h2><b>Patronus AI reports 15x revenue growth as enterprise demand for agent training surges</b></h2><p>Patronus AI positions Generative Simulators as the foundation for a new product line it calls &quot;<a href=""https://www.patronus.ai/rl-environments"">RL Environments</a>&quot; — training grounds designed for foundation model laboratories and enterprises building agents for specific domains. The company says this offering represents a strategic expansion beyond its original focus on evaluation tools.</p><p>&quot;We&#x27;ve grown 15x in revenue this year, largely due to the high-quality environments we&#x27;ve developed that have been shown to be extremely learnable by different kinds of frontier models,&quot; Kannappan said.</p><p>The CEO declined to specify absolute revenue figures but said the new product has allowed the company to &quot;move higher up the stack in terms of where we sell and who we sell to.&quot; The company&#x27;s platform is used by numerous Fortune 500 enterprises and leading AI companies around the world.</p><h2><b>Why OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google can&#x27;t build everything in-house</b></h2><p>A central question facing <a href=""https://www.patronus.ai/"">Patronus AI</a> is why the deep-pocketed laboratories developing frontier models—organizations like <a href=""https://openai.com/"">OpenAI</a>, <a href=""https://www.anthropic.com/"">Anthropic</a>, and <a href=""https://deepmind.google/"">Google DeepMind</a> — would license training infrastructure rather than build it themselves.</p><p>Kannappan acknowledged that these companies &quot;are investing significantly in environments&quot; but argued that the breadth of domains requiring specialized training creates a natural opening for third-party providers.</p><p>&quot;They want to improve agents on lots of different domains, whether it&#x27;s coding or tool use or navigating browsers or workflows across finance, healthcare, energy, and education,&quot; he said. &quot;Solving all those different operational problems is very difficult for a single company to do.&quot;</p><p>The competitive landscape is intensifying. Microsoft recently released <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/agent-lightning/"">Agent Lightning</a>, an open-source framework that makes reinforcement learning work for any AI agent without rewrites. NVIDIA&#x27;s <a href=""https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/gym/latest/index.html"">NeMo Gym</a> offers modular RL infrastructure for developing agentic AI systems. Meta researchers released <a href=""https://venturebeat.com/ai/metas-dreamgym-framework-trains-ai-agents-in-a-simulated-world-to-cut"">DreamGym</a> in November, a framework that simulates RL environments and dynamically adjusts task difficulty as agents improve.</p><h2><b>&#x27;Environments are the new oil&#x27;: Patronus AI&#x27;s audacious bet on the future of AI training</b></h2><p>Looking ahead, Patronus AI frames its mission in sweeping terms. The company wants to &quot;environmentalize all of the world&#x27;s data&quot; — converting human workflows into structured systems that AI can learn from.</p><p>&quot;We think that everything should be an environment—internally, we joke that environments are the new oil,&quot; Kannappan said. &quot;Reinforcement learning is just one training method, but the construct of an environment is what really matters.&quot;</p><p>Qian described the opportunity in expansive terms: &quot;This is an entirely new field of research, which doesn&#x27;t happen every day. Generative simulation is inspired by early research in robotics and embodied agents. It&#x27;s been a pipe dream for decades, and we&#x27;re only now able to achieve these ideas because of the capabilities of today&#x27;s models.&quot;</p><p>The company launched in September 2023 with a focus on evaluation — helping enterprises identify hallucinations and safety issues in AI outputs. That mission has now expanded upstream into training itself. Patronus AI argues that the traditional separation between evaluation and training is collapsing — and that whoever controls the environments where AI agents learn will shape their capabilities.</p><p>&quot;We are really at this critical point, this inflection point, where what we do right now will impact what the world is going to look like for generations to come,&quot; Qian said.</p><p>Whether <a href=""https://www.patronus.ai/rl-environments"">Generative Simulators</a> can deliver on that promise remains to be seen. The company&#x27;s 15x revenue growth suggests enterprise customers are hungry for solutions, but deep-pocketed players from <a href=""https://microsoft.com/"">Microsoft</a> to <a href=""https://www.meta.com/"">Meta</a> are racing to solve the same fundamental problem. If the last two years have taught the industry anything, it&#x27;s that in AI, the future has a habit of arriving ahead of schedule.</p>",VentureBeat,TECH
"Wed, 17 Dec 2025 14:00:00 GMT","Mistral launches OCR 3 to digitize enterprise documents, touts 74% win rate and $2-per-1,000-page pricing","<p><a href=""https://mistral.ai/"">Mistral AI</a>, the French artificial intelligence company valued at €11.7 billion, unveiled its third-generation optical character recognition model on Tuesday, positioning document digitization as the critical first step enterprises must take before realizing the full potential of generative AI.</p><p>The new model, called <a href=""https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-ocr"">Mistral OCR 3</a>, claims a 74% win rate against competing products when processing forms, scanned documents, complex tables, and handwritten content. Mistral priced the technology aggressively at $2 per 1,000 pages — with a 50% discount for batch processing — dramatically undercutting many established enterprise document processing solutions.</p><p>The release arrives at a pivotal moment for the two-year-old startup. Mistral has spent December on an aggressive product offensive, launching its <a href=""https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-3"">Mistral 3 family</a> of open-weight models, new coding tools called Devstral 2, and now OCR 3. The company faces intensifying pressure from American rivals flush with capital — OpenAI recently sold secondary shares at a reported $500 billion valuation, while Anthropic raised $13 billion in September — and potential regulatory friction as the Trump administration threatens retaliation against European companies over EU technology laws.</p><h2><b>Why enterprises can&#x27;t adopt AI until they solve their paper problem</b></h2><p>Marjorie Janiewicz, Mistral&#x27;s Chief Revenue Officer who oversees global revenue including solutions architecture and forward deployment engineering, framed the OCR release as a direct response to patterns the company observed while helping enterprises deploy AI over the past year.</p><p>&quot;A lot of very large enterprises are still sitting on a very large volume of critical data that&#x27;s not digitized yet,&quot; Janiewicz said in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. &quot;That data that&#x27;s not digitized represents a massive competitive moat.&quot;</p><p>The observation cuts to the heart of a widely documented problem in enterprise AI adoption. Despite billions invested in AI initiatives, most organizations struggle to move beyond proof-of-concept projects into production systems that generate measurable returns. Research consistently shows a significant gap between AI experimentation and real business value.</p><p>Janiewicz argued that document digitization creates two distinct opportunities. First, it unlocks institutional knowledge accumulated over decades — proprietary data that could power personalized AI systems and agents. Second, it enables the workflow automation that promises to transform day-to-day operations but remains stalled in document-heavy industries.</p><p>&quot;When you think about workflow transformation, a lot of enterprises today could benefit from really transformational workflow automation if the data that was core to their business was fully digitized,&quot; Janiewicz explained.</p><h2><b>From anti-money laundering to insurance claims, how OCR transforms regulated industries</b></h2><p>Mistral designed <a href=""https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-ocr"">OCR 3</a> to excel across the regulated, document-intensive industries where AI adoption has proven most challenging — and where the stakes for accuracy are highest.</p><p>In financial services, Janiewicz pointed to anti-money laundering compliance and know-your-customer processes, where banks process millions of documents annually to meet regulatory requirements. &quot;When you think about opening a bank account, or a lot of the tasks that are still being done in retail banks, it&#x27;s on paper,&quot; she said. &quot;When you start correlating that to anti-money laundering workflow automation processes, or KYC as a customer support process, where governance and being able to inspect things is so essential — a lot of the banks are talking to us about the need to accelerate the pace, the accuracy and the performance of the digitization process.&quot;</p><p>The insurance industry presents similar challenges. Claim management workflows require connecting photographs of vehicle damage, handwritten accident reports, and policy documentation to automated processing engines. Healthcare organizations grapple with admission forms, medical histories, prescription records, and consent documentation scattered across paper and digital formats.</p><p>Manufacturing drew particular enthusiasm from Janiewicz. &quot;I love manufacturing as an industry,&quot; she said. &quot;When you start thinking about the very complex technical documents, many of those documents are either not digitized yet, or they are so complex that extracting valuable information from them to accelerate the manufacturing process, or even innovation, is a challenge.&quot;</p><h2><b>Mistral claims major accuracy gains on handwriting, complex tables, and damaged scans</b></h2><p>According to Mistral&#x27;s benchmarks, <a href=""https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-ocr"">OCR 3</a> demonstrates significant improvements over its predecessor across several categories that have historically challenged optical character recognition systems.</p><p>The model interprets cursive handwriting, mixed-content annotations, and handwritten text layered over printed forms — scenarios that frequently produce errors in traditional OCR systems. It reconstructs complex table structures with headers, merged cells, multi-row blocks, and column hierarchies, outputting HTML table tags that preserve layout for downstream processing.</p><p>Perhaps most notably for organizations dealing with legacy documents, Mistral claims substantial improvements in handling the artifacts that plague real-world document processing: compression artifacts, skew, distortion, low resolution, and background noise.</p><p>Tim Law, IDC&#x27;s Director of Research for AI and Automation, underscored the strategic importance of the technology. &quot;OCR remains foundational for enabling generative AI and agentic AI,&quot; Law said. &quot;Those organizations that can efficiently and cost-effectively extract text and embedded images with high fidelity will unlock value and will gain a competitive advantage from their data by providing richer context.&quot;</p><p>When asked what prevents well-funded competitors from replicating Mistral&#x27;s approach within months, Janiewicz emphasized the accuracy gap that has frustrated enterprise deployments.</p><p>&quot;Enterprises have two and a half years of history with competitive OCR solutions, and the reason we think this is a real advantage for us is accuracy,&quot; she said. &quot;Many enterprises are complaining about the accuracy of those systems, which has slowed their ability to digitize their documents.&quot;</p><h2><b>How Mistral AI Studio creates a complete document-to-production pipeline</b></h2><p>Beyond raw model performance, Mistral positioned OCR 3 as part of a vertically integrated stack designed for complex enterprise deployments. The model operates within <a href=""https://mistral.ai/solutions/document-ai"">Document AI</a>, a component of <a href=""https://mistral.ai/news/ai-studio"">Mistral AI Studio</a> that the company introduced in October as its production platform for enterprise AI development.</p><p>Mistral AI Studio provides observability, agent runtime capabilities, and an AI registry — infrastructure Janiewicz described as essential for moving AI from experimentation to reliable production systems. <a href=""https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-ocr"">OCR 3</a> feeds directly into this ecosystem, connecting document processing to the company&#x27;s broader model offerings and workflow tools.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s the vertical integration of OCR, the models, and Studio, coupled with accuracy, that I think is creating a very differentiated play,&quot; Janiewicz said. &quot;Most companies today are struggling with off-the-shelf solutions not being good enough to help them transform a complex workflow.&quot;</p><p>The release supports deployment across cloud, virtual private cloud, and on-premises environments — flexibility that matters enormously for regulated industries where data sovereignty and security concerns dictate infrastructure decisions.</p><h2><b>Keeping enterprise data &#x27;home&#x27; in an era of AI security concerns</b></h2><p>For financial services, healthcare, and other heavily regulated industries, questions about data handling during AI processing carry significant weight. Janiewicz addressed these concerns directly.</p><p>&quot;Many times the models are going to be used on their own GPUs,&quot; she said, referring to on-premises and VPC deployments. &quot;That&#x27;s a great way to make sure companies feel that the data is home — it&#x27;s not going to be exposed to anyone else.&quot;</p><p>On the sensitive question of training data, Janiewicz was unequivocal: &quot;For all our training, we never use our customers&#x27; data to train.&quot;</p><p>The company announced a <a href=""https://www.hsbc.com/news-and-views/news/hsbc-news-archive/we-re-partnering-with-ai-powerhouse-mistral"">partnership with HSBC</a> in recent weeks to build productivity tools for the multinational bank — a significant validation of Mistral&#x27;s enterprise security posture in one of the world&#x27;s most demanding regulatory environments.</p><h2><b>Mistral&#x27;s December product blitz signals an aggressive push against OpenAI and Anthropic</b></h2><p>The <a href=""https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-ocr"">OCR 3 release</a> extends Mistral&#x27;s December product blitz, which began when the company launched its <a href=""https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-3"">Mistral 3 family</a> of open-weight models on December 2. That release included <a href=""https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-Large-3-675B-Instruct-2512"">Mistral Large 3</a>, a frontier model with multimodal and multilingual capabilities, alongside nine smaller <a href=""https://huggingface.co/collections/mistralai/ministral-3"">Ministral 3 models</a> designed for edge deployment on devices with limited connectivity.</p><p>The company followed up a week later with <a href=""https://mistral.ai/news/devstral-2-vibe-cli"">Devstral 2</a>, a new generation of coding models, and Mistral Vibe, a command-line interface for code automation through natural language — a direct play for the &quot;vibe coding&quot; market that has fueled the rise of companies like Cursor.</p><p>These releases build on substantial infrastructure partnerships. <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/"">Microsoft</a> distributes Mistral models through <a href=""https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-foundry"">Azure Foundry</a>, with OCR 3 expected to become available on the platform. Amazon Web Services added <a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-bedrock-adds-fully-managed-open-weight-models/"">Mistral Large 3 and Ministral 3 models to Amazon Bedrock</a> in early December, providing fully managed access alongside models from Google, OpenAI, and others.</p><p>Mistral&#x27;s roughly <a href=""https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-ai-raises-1-7-b-to-accelerate-technological-progress-with-ai"">$2 billion (€1.7 billion) Series C</a> round in September, led by Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML with participation from NVIDIA, DST Global, and Andreessen Horowitz, gave the company resources to accelerate development. But the funding pales against American competitors — OpenAI sold secondary shares in October at a <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/02/openai-share-sale-500-billion-valuation.html"">$500 billion valuation</a>, making it the world&#x27;s most valuable private company, while Anthropic reached a <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/18/anthropic-ai-azure-microsoft-nvidia.html"">$350 billion valuation</a> in November following investments from Microsoft and Nvidia.</p><p>Guillaume Lample, Mistral&#x27;s co-founder and chief scientist, has argued that bigger isn&#x27;t always better for enterprise use cases. &quot;In practice, the huge majority of enterprise use cases are things that can be tackled by small models, especially if you fine-tune them,&quot; Lample said in a recent interview with <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/mistral-closes-in-on-big-ai-rivals-with-mistral-3-open-weight-frontier-and-small-models/"">TechCrunch</a>.</p><p>Janiewicz echoed this philosophy. &quot;The biggest learning over the past 12 months is that off-the-shelf AI is not cutting it in driving real value for the enterprise in production,&quot; she said. &quot;Customization of the models, customization of the technology, giving control back to enterprises to build their own AI solutions — that&#x27;s absolutely paramount.&quot;</p><h2><b>US-EU technology tensions create new risks for European AI companies</b></h2><p>Mistral&#x27;s aggressive expansion comes as European technology companies face potential regulatory retaliation from the United States. The Trump administration warned last week that it would use &quot;<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/16/business/economy/us-eu-tech-penalties.html"">every tool at its disposal</a>&quot; if the European Union continued enforcing its technology laws, putting companies including Mistral, Spotify, Siemens, and Publicis in a precarious position.</p><p>The European Commission responded that its rules &quot;apply equally and fairly to all companies operating in the EU,&quot; but the standoff introduces uncertainty for European AI companies seeking American enterprise customers.</p><p>Mistral has differentiated itself from Chinese competitors like <a href=""https://www.deepseek.com/"">DeepSeek</a> and Alibaba&#x27;s <a href=""https://qwen.ai/"">Qwen</a> by emphasizing its <a href=""https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0"">Apache 2.0 licensing</a> and worldwide availability without regional restrictions — a positioning that takes on added significance amid escalating technology tensions between major economic blocs.</p><h2><b>Aggressive pricing suggests Mistral sees OCR as a gateway to deeper enterprise relationships</b></h2><p>Janiewicz outlined three revenue pillars for Mistral: complex workflow transformation using <a href=""https://mistral.ai/news/ai-studio"">Mistral Studio</a> and forward deployment engineering; research and development partnerships to co-build specialized models; and productivity tools including the <a href=""https://mistral.ai/products/le-chat"">Le Chat assistant</a> and <a href=""https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-code"">Mistral Code</a> for developers.</p><p>Document AI and OCR fit into the first pillar while potentially serving as an entry point that leads customers into deeper engagements. &quot;OCR is a great way to get those enterprises started and being able to start showing some concrete results,&quot; Janiewicz said.</p><p>The aggressive pricing — significantly below many enterprise document processing alternatives — suggests Mistral views OCR as a wedge product rather than a primary profit center. Early customers use the technology to process invoices into structured fields, digitize corporate archives, extract clean text from technical and scientific reports, and improve enterprise search.</p><p>The company also highlighted accessibility applications. AI-powered OCR can transform printed, handwritten, or scanned documents into searchable digital formats compatible with screen readers and assistive technologies — a capability with implications for compliance with disability access requirements in education and government.</p><h2><b>The unsexy problem that could determine who wins the enterprise AI race</b></h2><p>Mistral&#x27;s OCR 3 is a calculated wager that the path to enterprise AI dominance runs not through ever-larger language models, but through the unglamorous work of converting paper into data. While competitors race to build more powerful chatbots and autonomous agents, the French startup is betting that enterprises can&#x27;t use any of those tools until they first digitize the institutional knowledge buried in filing cabinets and PDF archives.</p><p>&quot;For us, OCR is a great way to get those enterprises started and being able to start showing some concrete results,&quot; Janiewicz said. &quot;To us, really, the key message is customization, portability, and control is the secret sauce to ROI.&quot;</p><p>The model becomes available Tuesday through <a href=""https://docs.mistral.ai/api"">Mistral&#x27;s API</a> and the <a href=""https://mistral.ai/solutions/document-ai"">Document AI interface</a> in Mistral AI Studio.

"Wed, 17 Dec 2025 08:00:00 GMT",AI is moving to the edge – and network security needs to catch up,"<p><i>Presented by T-Mobile for Business</i></p><hr /><p>Small and mid-sized businesses are adopting AI at a pace that would have seemed unrealistic even a few years ago. Smart assistants that greet customers, predictive tools that flag inventory shortages before they happen, and on-site analytics that help staff make decisions faster — these used to be features of the enterprise. Now they’re being deployed in retail storefronts, regional medical clinics, branch offices, and remote operations hubs.</p><p>What’s changed is not just the AI itself, but where it runs. Increasingly, AI workloads are being pushed out of centralized data centers and into the real world — into the places where employees work and customers interact. This shift to the edge promises faster insights and more resilient operations, but it also transforms the demands placed on the network. Edge sites need consistent bandwidth, real-time data pathways, and the ability to process information locally rather than relying on the cloud for every decision.</p><p>The catch is that as companies race to connect these locations, security often lags behind. A store may adopt AI-enabled cameras or sensors long before it has the policies to manage them. A clinic may roll out mobile diagnostic devices without fully segmenting their traffic. A warehouse may rely on a mix of Wi-Fi, wired, and cellular connections that weren’t designed to support AI-driven operations. When connectivity scales faster than security, it creates cracks — unmonitored devices, inconsistent access controls, and unsegmented data flows that make it hard to see what’s happening, let alone protect it.</p><p>Edge AI only delivers its full value when connectivity and security evolve together.</p><h3>Why AI is moving to the edge — and what that breaks</h3><p>Businesses are shifting AI to the edge for three core reasons:</p><ul><li><p><b>Real-time responsiveness: </b>Some decisions can’t wait for a round trip to the cloud. Whether it’s identifying an item on a shelf, detecting an abnormal reading from a medical device, or recognizing a safety risk in a warehouse aisle, the delay introduced by centralized processing can mean missed opportunities or slow reactions.</p></li><li><p><b>Resilience and privacy: </b>Keeping data and inference local makes operations less vulnerable to outages or latency spikes, and it reduces the flow of sensitive information across networks. This helps SMBs meet data sovereignty and compliance requirements without rewriting their entire infrastructure.</p></li><li><p><b>Mobility and deployment speed: </b>Many SMBs operate across distributed footprints — remote workers, pop-up locations, seasonal operations, or mobile teams. Wireless-first connectivity, including 5G business lines, lets them deploy AI tools quickly without waiting for fixed circuits or expensive buildouts.</p></li></ul><p>Technologies like Edge Control from <a href=""https://tmobilebusinessgroup.sjv.io/c/2562575/3301556/37552"">T-Mobile for Business</a> fit naturally into this model. By routing traffic directly along the paths it needs — keeping latency-sensitive workloads local and bypassing the bottlenecks that traditional VPNs introduce — businesses can adopt edge AI without dragging their network into constant contention.</p><p>Yet the shift introduces new risk. Every edge site becomes, in effect, its own small data center. A retail store may have cameras, sensors, POS systems, digital signage, and staff devices all sharing the same access point. A clinic may run diagnostic tools, tablets, wearables, and video consult systems side by side. A manufacturing floor might combine robotics, sensors, handheld scanners, and on-site analytics platforms.</p><p>This diversity increases the attack surface dramatically. Many SMBs roll out connectivity first, then add piecemeal security later — leaving the blind spots attackers rely on.</p><h3>Zero trust becomes essential at the edge</h3><p>When AI is distributed across dozens or hundreds of sites, the old idea of a single secure “inside” network breaks down. Every store, clinic, kiosk, or field location becomes its own micro-environment — and every device within it becomes its own potential entry point.</p><p>Zero trust offers a framework to make this manageable.</p><p>At the edge, zero trust means:</p><ul><li><p><b>Verifying identity rather than location </b>— access is granted because a user or device proves who it is, not because it sits behind a corporate firewall.</p></li><li><p><b>Continuous authentication</b> — trust isn’t permanent; it’s re-evaluated throughout a session.</p></li><li><p><b>Segmentation that limits movement</b> — if something goes wrong, attackers can’t jump freely from system to system.</p></li></ul><p>This approach is especially critical given that many edge devices can’t run traditional security clients. SIM-based identity and secure mobile connectivity — areas where T-Mobile for Business brings significant strength — help verify IoT devices, 5G routers, and sensors that otherwise sit outside the visibility of IT teams.</p><p>This is why connectivity providers are increasingly combining networking and security into a single approach. T-Mobile for Business embeds segmentation, device visibility, and zero-trust safeguards directly into its wireless-first connectivity offerings, reducing the need for SMBs to stitch together multiple tools.</p><h3>Secure-by-default networks reshape the landscape</h3><p>A major architectural shift is underway: networks that assume every device, session, and workload must be authenticated, segmented, and monitored from the start. Instead of building security on top of connectivity, the two are fused.</p><p><a href=""https://tmobilebusinessgroup.sjv.io/c/2562575/3301556/37552"">T-Mobile for Business</a> solutions shows how this is evolving. Its SASE platform, powered by Palo Alto Networks Prisma SASE 5G, blends secure access with connectivity into one cloud-delivered service. Private Access gives users the least-privileged access they need, nothing more. T-SIMsecure authenticates devices at the SIM layer, allowing IoT sensors and 5G routers to be verified automatically. Security Slice isolates sensitive SASE traffic on a dedicated portion of the 5G network, ensuring consistency even during heavy demand.</p><p>A unified dashboard like T-Platform brings it together, offering real-time visibility across SASE, IoT, business internet, and edge control — simplifying operations for SMBs with limited staff.</p><h3><b>The future: AI that runs the edge and protects it</b></h3><p>As AI models become more dynamic and autonomous, we’ll see the relationship flip: the edge won’t just support AI; AI will actively run and secure the edge — optimizing traffic paths, adjusting segmentation automatically, and spotting anomalies that matter to one specific store or site.</p><p>Self-healing networks and adaptive policy engines will move from experimental to expected.</p><p>For SMBs, this is a pivotal moment. The organizations that modernize their connectivity and security foundations now will be the ones best positioned to scale AI everywhere — safely, confidently, and without unnecessary complexity.</p><p>Partners like<a href=""https://tmobilebusinessgroup.sjv.io/c/2562575/3301556/37552""> T-Mobile for Business</a> are already moving in this direction, giving SMBs a way to deploy AI at the edge without sacrificing control or visibility.</p><hr /><p><i>Sponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.

"Wed, 17 Dec 2025 03:21:00 GMT",Why Google's new Interactions API is such a big deal for AI developers,"<p>For the last two years, the fundamental unit of generative AI development has been the &quot;completion.&quot; </p><p>You send a text prompt to a model, it sends text back, and the transaction ends. If you want to continue the conversation, you have to send the entire history back to the model again. This &quot;stateless&quot; architecture—embodied by Google&#x27;s legacy <code>generateContent</code> endpoint—was perfect for simple chatbots. But as developers move toward autonomous agents that use tools, maintain complex states, and &quot;think&quot; over long horizons, that stateless model has become a distinct bottleneck.</p><p>Last week, Google DeepMind finally addressed this infrastructure gap with the <a href=""https://blog.google/technology/developers/interactions-api/"">public beta launch of the Interactions API</a> (<code>/interactions</code>).</p><p>While <a href=""https://venturebeat.com/programming-development/openai-unveils-responses-api-open-source-agents-sdk-letting-developers-build-their-own-deep-research-and-operator"">OpenAI began this shift back in March 2025 with its Responses API</a>, Google’s entry signals its own efforts to advance the state-of-the-art. The Interactions API is not just a state management tool; it is a unified interface designed to treat LLMs less like text generators and more like remote operating systems.</p><h3><b>The &#x27;Remote Compute&#x27; Model</b></h3><p>The core innovation of the Interactions API is the introduction of server-side state as a default behavior.</p><p>Previously, a developer building a complex agent had to manually manage a growing JSON list of every &quot;user&quot; and &quot;model&quot; turn, sending megabytes of history back and forth with every request. With the new API, developers simply pass a <code>previous_interaction_id</code>. Google’s infrastructure retains the conversation history, tool outputs, and &quot;thought&quot; processes on their end.</p><p>&quot;Models are becoming systems and over time, might even become agents themselves,&quot; wrote DeepMind&#x27;s Ali Çevik and Philipp Schmid, in an official company <a href=""https://blog.google/technology/developers/interactions-api/"">blog post</a> on the new paradigm. &quot;Trying to force these capabilities into <code>generateContent</code> would have resulted in an overly complex and fragile API.&quot;</p><p>This shift enables Background Execution, a critical feature for the agentic era. Complex workflows—like browsing the web for an hour to synthesize a report—often trigger HTTP timeouts in standard APIs. The Interactions API allows developers to trigger an agent with <code>background=true,</code> disconnect, and poll for the result later. It effectively turns the API into a job queue for intelligence.</p><h3><b>Native &quot;Deep Research&quot; and MCP Support</b></h3><p>Google is using this new infrastructure to deliver its first built-in agent: Gemini Deep Research.</p><p>Accessible via the same <code>/interactions</code> endpoint, this agent is capable of executing &quot;long-horizon research tasks.&quot; Unlike a standard model that predicts the next token based on your prompt, the Deep Research agent executes a loop of searches, reading, and synthesis.</p><p>Crucially, Google is also embracing the open ecosystem by adding native support for the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This allows Gemini models to directly call external tools hosted on remote servers—such as a weather service or a database—without the developer having to write custom glue code to parse the tool calls.</p><h3><b>The Landscape: Google Joins OpenAI in the &#x27;Stateful&#x27; Era</b></h3><p>Google is arguably playing catch-up, but with a distinct philosophical twist. OpenAI moved away from statelessness nine months ago with the<a href=""https://venturebeat.com/programming-development/openai-unveils-responses-api-open-source-agents-sdk-letting-developers-build-their-own-deep-research-and-operator""> launch of the Responses API in March 2025</a>.</p><p>While both giants are solving the problem of context bloat, their solutions diverge on transparency:</p><p><b>OpenAI (The Compression Approach): </b>OpenAI&#x27;s Responses API introduced Compaction—a feature that shrinks conversation history by replacing tool outputs and reasoning chains with opaque &quot;encrypted compaction items.&quot; This prioritizes token efficiency but creates a &quot;black box&quot; where the model&#x27;s past reasoning is hidden from the developer.</p><p><b>Google (The Hosted Approach):</b> Google’s Interactions API keeps the full history available and composable. The data model allows developers to &quot;debug, manipulate, stream and reason over interleaved messages.&quot; It prioritizes inspectability over compression.</p><h3><b>Supported Models &amp; Availability</b></h3><p>The Interactions API is currently in Public Beta (<a href=""https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/interactions?ua=tool-use"">documentation here</a>) and is available immediately via Google AI Studio. It supports the full spectrum of Google’s latest generation models, ensuring that developers can match the right model size to their specific agentic task:</p><ul><li><p><b>Gemini 3.0:</b> Gemini 3 Pro Preview.</p></li><li><p><b>Gemini 2.5:</b> Flash, Flash-lite, and Pro.</p></li><li><p><b>Agents:</b> Deep Research Preview (<code>deep-research-pro-preview-12-2025</code>).</p></li></ul><p>Commercially, the API integrates into Google’s existing pricing structure—you pay standard rates for input and output tokens based on the model you select. However, the value proposition changes with the new data retention policies. Because this API is stateful, Google must store your interaction history to enable features like implicit caching and context retrieval.</p><p>Access to this storage is determined by your tier. Developers on the Free Tier are limited to a 1-day retention policy, suitable for ephemeral testing but insufficient for long-term agent memory. </p><p>Developers on the Paid Tier unlock a 55-day retention policy. This extended retention is not just for auditing; it effectively lowers your total cost of ownership by maximizing cache hits. By keeping the history &quot;hot&quot; on the server for nearly two months, you avoid paying to re-process massive context windows for recurring users, making the Paid Tier significantly more efficient for production-grade agents.</p><p>Note: As this is a Beta release, Google has advised that features and schemas are subject to breaking changes.</p><h3><b>&#x27;You Are Interacting With a System&#x27;</b></h3><p>Sam Witteveen, a Google Developer Expert in Machine Learning and CEO of Red Dragon AI, sees this release as a necessary evolution of the developer stack.</p><p>&quot;If we go back in history... the whole idea was simple text-in, text-out,&quot; Witteveen noted in a <a href=""https://youtu.be/aZgH_wnmedQ?si=AymwEOfXGUSSvvyz"">technical breakdown of the release on YouTube.</a> &quot;But now... you are interacting with a system. A system that can use multiple models, do multiple loops of calls, use tools, and do code execution on the backend.&quot;</p><div></div><p>Witteveen highlighted the immediate economic benefit of this architecture: Implicit Caching. Because the conversation history lives on Google’s servers, developers aren&#x27;t charged for re-uploading the same context repeatedly. &quot;You don&#x27;t have to pay as much for the tokens that you are calling,&quot; he explained.</p><p>However, the release is not without friction. Witteveen critiqued the current implementation of the Deep Research agent&#x27;s citation system. While the agent provides sources, the URLs returned are often wrapped in internal Google/Vertex AI redirection links rather than raw, usable URLs.</p><p>&quot;My biggest gripe is that... these URLs, if I save them and try to use them in a different session, they&#x27;re not going to work,&quot; Witteveen warned. &quot;If I want to make a report for someone with citations, I want them to be able to click on the URLs from a PDF file... Having something like medium.com as a citation [without the direct link] is not very good.&quot;</p><h3><b>What This Means for Your Team</b></h3><p>For Lead AI Engineers focused on rapid model deployment and fine-tuning, this release offers a direct architectural solution to the persistent &quot;timeout&quot; problem: Background Execution. </p><p>Instead of building complex asynchronous handlers or managing separate job queues for long-running reasoning tasks, you can now offload this complexity directly to Google. However, this convenience introduces a strategic trade-off. </p><p>While the new Deep Research agent allows for the rapid deployment of sophisticated research capabilities, it operates as a &quot;black box&quot; compared to custom-built LangChain or LangGraph flows. Engineers should prototype a &quot;slow thinking&quot; feature using the <code>background=true</code> parameter to evaluate if the speed of implementation outweighs the loss of fine-grained control over the research loop.</p><p>Senior engineers managing AI orchestration and budget will find that the shift to server-side state via <code>previous_interaction_id</code> unlocks Implicit Caching, a major win for both cost and latency metrics. </p><p>By referencing history stored on Google’s servers, you automatically avoid the token costs associated with re-uploading massive context windows, directly addressing budget constraints while maintaining high performance. </p><p>The challenge here lies in the supply chain; incorporating Remote MCP (Model Context Protocol) means your agents are connecting directly to external tools, requiring you to rigorously validate that these remote services are secure and authenticated. It is time to audit your current token spend on re-sending conversation history—if it is high, prioritizing a migration to the stateful Interactions API could capture significant savings.</p><p>For Senior Data Engineers, the Interactions API offers a more robust data model than raw text logs. The structured schema allows for complex histories to be debugged and reasoned over, improving overall Data Integrity across your pipelines. However, you must remain vigilant regarding Data Quality, specifically the issue raised by expert Sam Witteveen regarding citations. </p><p>The Deep Research agent currently returns &quot;wrapped&quot; URLs that may expire or break, rather than raw source links. If your pipelines rely on scraping or archiving these sources, you may need to build a cleaning step to extract the usable URLs. You should also test the structured output capabilities (<code>response_format</code>) to see if they can replace fragile regex parsing in your current ETL pipelines.</p><p>Finally, for Directors of IT Security, moving state to Google’s centralized servers offers a paradox. It can improve security by keeping API keys and conversation history off client devices, but it introduces a new data residency risk. The critical check here is Google&#x27;s Data Retention Policies: while the Free Tier retains data for only one day, the Paid Tier retains interaction history for 55 days. </p><p>This stands in contrast to OpenAI’s &quot;Zero Data Retention&quot; (ZDR) enterprise options. You must ensure that storing sensitive conversation history for nearly two months complies with your internal governance. If this violates your policy, you must configure calls with <code>store=false</code>, though doing so will disable the stateful features—and the cost benefits—that make this new API valuable.</p>",VentureBeat,TECH
"Wed, 17 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT",Agentic design patterns: The missing link between AI demos and enterprise value,"<p>The enterprise AI market is currently nursing a massive hangover. For the past two years, decision-makers have been inundated with demos of autonomous agents booking flights, writing code, and analyzing data. Yet, the reality on the ground is starkly different. While experimentation is at an all-time high, deployment of reliable, autonomous agents in production remains challenging. </p><p>A <a href=""https://venturebeat.com/ai/mit-report-misunderstood-shadow-ai-economy-booms-while-headlines-cry-failure"">recent study by MIT’s Project NANDA</a> highlighted a sobering statistic: Roughly 95% of AI projects fail to deliver bottom-line value. They hit walls when moved from the sandbox to the real world, often breaking under the weight of edge cases, hallucinations, or integration failures.</p><p>According to Antonio Gulli, a senior engineer at Google and the Director of the Engineering Office of the CTO, the industry is suffering from a fundamental misunderstanding of what agents actually are. We have treated them as magic boxes rather than complex software systems. &quot;AI engineering, especially with large models and agents, is really no different from any form of engineering, like software or civil engineering,&quot; Gulli said in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. &quot;To build something lasting, you cannot just chase the latest model or framework.&quot;</p><p>Gulli argues that the solution to the &quot;trough of disillusionment&quot; is not a smarter model, but better architecture. His recent book, &quot;<a href=""https://www.amazon.de/Agentic-Design-Patterns-Hands-Intelligent/dp/3032014018"">Agentic Design Patterns</a>,&quot; provides repeatable, rigorous architectural standards that turn &quot;toy&quot; agents into reliable enterprise tools. The book pays homage to the original &quot;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns"">Design Patterns</a>&quot; (one of my favorite books on software engineering), which brought order to object-oriented programming in the 1990s.</p><p>Gulli introduces 21 fundamental patterns that serve as the building blocks for reliable agentic systems. These are practical engineering structures that dictate how an agent thinks, remembers, and acts. &quot;Of course, it&#x27;s important to have the state-of-the-art, but you need to step back and reflect on the fundamental principles driving AI systems,&quot; Gulli said. &quot;These patterns are the engineering foundation that improves the solution quality.&quot;</p><h2>The enterprise survival kit</h2><p>For enterprise leaders looking to stabilize their AI stack, Gulli identifies five &quot;low-hanging fruit&quot; patterns that offer the highest immediate impact: Reflection, Routing, Communication, Guardrails, and Memory. The most critical shift in agent design is the move from simple &quot;stimulus-response&quot; bots to systems capable of <b>Reflection</b>. A standard LLM tries to answer a query immediately, which often leads to hallucination. A reflective agent, however, mimics human reasoning by creating a plan, executing it, and then critiquing its own output before presenting it to the user. This internal feedback loop is often the difference between a wrong answer and a correct one.</p><p>Once an agent can think, it needs to be efficient. This is where <b>Routing</b> becomes essential for cost control. Instead of sending every query to a massive, expensive &quot;God model,&quot; a routing layer analyzes the complexity of the request. Simple tasks are directed to faster, cheaper models, while complex reasoning is reserved for the heavy hitters. This architecture allows enterprises to scale without blowing up their inference budgets. “A model can act as a router to other models, or even the same model with different system prompts and functions,” Gulli said.</p><p>Connecting these agents to the outside world requires standardized <b>Communication </b>by giving models access to tools such as search, queries, and code execution. In the past, connecting an LLM to a database meant writing custom, brittle code. Gulli points to the rise of the <a href=""https://venturebeat.com/ai/model-context-protocol-a-promising-ai-integration-layer-but-not-a-standard-yet""><b>Model Context Protocol</b></a><b> (MCP)</b> as a pivotal moment. MCP acts like a USB port for AI, providing a standardized way for agents to plug into data sources and tools. This standardization extends to &quot;<a href=""https://venturebeat.com/ai/googles-agent2agent-interoperability-protocol-aims-to-standardize-agentic-communication"">Agent-to-Agent</a>&quot; (A2A) communication, allowing specialized agents to collaborate on complex tasks without custom integration overhead.</p><p>However, even a smart, efficient agent is useless if it cannot retain information. <b>Memory</b> patterns solve the &quot;goldfish&quot; problem, where agents forget instructions over long conversations. By structuring how an agent stores and retrieves <a href=""https://venturebeat.com/ai/new-memory-framework-builds-ai-agents-that-can-handle-the-real-worlds"">past interactions and experiences</a>, developers can create persistent, context-aware assistants. “The way you create memory is fundamental for the quality of the agents,” Gulli said.</p><p>Finally, none of this matters if the agent is a liability. <b>Guardrails</b> provide the necessary constraints to ensure an agent operates within safety and compliance boundaries. This goes beyond a simple system prompt asking the model to &quot;be nice&quot;; it involves architectural checks and escalation policies that prevent data leakage or unauthorized actions. Gulli emphasizes that defining these &quot;hard&quot; boundaries is &quot;extremely important&quot; for security, ensuring that an agent trying to be helpful doesn&#x27;t accidentally expose private data or execute irreversible commands outside its authorized scope.</p><h2>Fixing reliability with transactional safety</h2><p>For many CIOs, the hesitation to deploy agents stems from fear. An autonomous agent that can read emails or modify files poses a significant risk if it goes off the rails. Gulli addresses this by borrowing a concept from database management: <b>transactional safety</b>. &quot;If an agent takes an action, we must implement checkpoints and rollbacks, just as we do for transactional safety in databases,&quot; Gulli said.</p><p>In this model, an agent’s actions are tentative until validated. If the system detects an anomaly or an error, it can &quot;rollback&quot; to a previous safe state, undoing the agent’s actions. This safety net allows enterprises to trust agents with write-access to systems, knowing there is an undo button. Testing these systems requires a new approach as well. Traditional unit tests check if a function returns the right value, but an agent might arrive at the right answer via a flawed, dangerous process. Gulli advocates for evaluating <b>Agent Trajectories</b>, metrics that evaluate how agents behave over time.</p><p>“[Agent Trajectories] involves analyzing the entire sequence of decisions and tools used to reach a conclusion, ensuring the full process is sound, not just the final answer,” he said.</p><p>This is often augmented by the <b>Critique</b> pattern, where a separate, specialized agent is tasked with judging the performance of the primary agent. This mutual check is fundamental to preventing the propagation of errors, essentially creating an automated peer-review system for AI decisions.</p><h2>Future-proofing: From prompt engineering to context engineering</h2><p>Looking toward 2026, the era of the single, general-purpose model is likely ending. Gulli predicts a shift toward a landscape dominated by fleets of specialized agents. &quot;I strongly believe we will see a specialization of agents,&quot; he said. &quot;The model will still be the brain... but the agents will become truly multi-agent systems with specialized tasks—agents focusing on retrieval, image generation, video creation — communicating with each other.&quot;</p><p>In this future, the primary skill for developers will not be to coax a model into working with clever phrasing and prompt engineering. Instead, they will need to focus on <a href=""https://venturebeat.com/ai/how-context-engineering-can-save-your-company-from-ai-vibe-code-overload"">context engineering</a>, the discipline that focuses on designing the information flow, managing the state, and curating the context that the model &quot;sees.&quot; </p><p>It is a move from linguistic trickery to systems engineering. By adopting these patterns and focusing on the &quot;plumbing&quot; of AI rather than just the models, enterprises can finally bridge the gap between the hype and the bottom line. &quot;We should not use AI just for the sake of AI,&quot; Gulli warns. &quot;We must start with a clear definition of the business problem and how to best leverage the technology to solve it.&quot;</p><p>

"Tue, 16 Dec 2025 14:00:00 GMT",Zoom says it aced AI’s hardest exam. Critics say it copied off its neighbors.,"<p><a href=""https://www.zoom.com/"">Zoom Video Communications</a>, the company best known for keeping remote workers connected during the pandemic, announced last week that it had achieved the highest score ever recorded on one of artificial intelligence&#x27;s most demanding tests — a claim that sent ripples of surprise, skepticism, and genuine curiosity through the technology industry.</p><p>The San Jose-based company said its AI system scored <a href=""https://www.zoom.com/en/blog/humanitys-last-exam-zoom-ai-breakthrough/?utm_source=social&amp;utm_medium=organic-social"">48.1 percent</a> on the <a href=""https://agi.safe.ai/"">Humanity&#x27;s Last Exam</a>, a benchmark designed by subject-matter experts worldwide to stump even the most advanced AI models. That result edges out Google&#x27;s <a href=""https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3/"">Gemini 3 Pro</a>, which held the previous record at 45.8 percent.</p><p>&quot;Zoom has achieved a new state-of-the-art result on the challenging Humanity&#x27;s Last Exam full-set benchmark, scoring 48.1%, which represents a substantial 2.3% improvement over the previous SOTA result,&quot; wrote Xuedong Huang, Zoom&#x27;s chief technology officer, in a <a href=""https://www.zoom.com/en/blog/humanitys-last-exam-zoom-ai-breakthrough"">blog pos</a>t.</p><p>The announcement raises a provocative question that has consumed AI watchers for days: How did a video conferencing company — one with no public history of training large language models — suddenly vault past <a href=""https://www.google.com/?zx=1765849295623&amp;no_sw_cr=1"">Google</a>, <a href=""https://openai.com/"">OpenAI</a>, and <a href=""https://www.anthropic.com/"">Anthropic</a> on a benchmark built to measure the frontiers of machine intelligence?</p><p>The answer reveals as much about where AI is headed as it does about Zoom&#x27;s own technical ambitions. And depending on whom you ask, it&#x27;s either an ingenious demonstration of practical engineering or a hollow claim that appropriates credit for others&#x27; work.</p><p><b>How Zoom built an AI traffic controller instead of training its own model</b></p><p>Zoom did not train its own large language model. Instead, the company developed what it calls a &quot;<a href=""https://www.zoom.com/en/blog/humanitys-last-exam-zoom-ai-breakthrough"">federated AI approach</a>&quot; — a system that routes queries to multiple existing models from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, then uses proprietary software to select, combine, and refine their outputs.</p><p>At the heart of this system sits what Zoom calls its &quot;<a href=""https://www.zoom.com/en/blog/federated-ai-approach-best-quality-for-most-popular-features/"">Z-scorer</a>,&quot; a mechanism that evaluates responses from different models and chooses the best one for any given task. The company pairs this with what it describes as an &quot;explore-verify-federate strategy,&quot; an agentic workflow that balances exploratory reasoning with verification across multiple AI systems.</p><p>&quot;Our federated approach combines Zoom&#x27;s own small language models with advanced open-source and closed-source models,&quot; Huang wrote. The framework &quot;orchestrates diverse models to generate, challenge, and refine reasoning through dialectical collaboration.&quot;</p><p>In simpler terms: Zoom built a sophisticated traffic controller for AI, not the AI itself.</p><p>This distinction matters enormously in an industry where bragging rights — and billions in valuation — often hinge on who can claim the most capable model. The major AI laboratories spend hundreds of millions of dollars training frontier systems on vast computing clusters. Zoom&#x27;s achievement, by contrast, appears to rest on clever integration of those existing systems.</p><h2><b>Why AI researchers are divided over what counts as real innovation</b></h2><p>The response from the AI community was swift and sharply divided.</p><p><a href=""https://x.com/maxrumpf"">Max Rumpf</a>, an AI engineer who says he has trained state-of-the-art language models, posted a pointed critique on social media. &quot;Zoom strung together API calls to Gemini, GPT, Claude et al. and slightly improved on a benchmark that delivers no value for their customers,&quot; he wrote. &quot;They then claim SOTA.&quot;</p><p>Rumpf did not dismiss the technical approach itself. Using multiple models for different tasks, he noted, is &quot;actually quite smart and most applications should do this.&quot; He pointed to Sierra, an AI customer service company, as an example of this multi-model strategy executed effectively.</p><p>His objection was more specific: &quot;They did not train the model, but obfuscate this fact in the tweet. The injustice of taking credit for the work of others sits deeply with people.&quot;</p><p>But other observers saw the achievement differently. <a href=""https://x.com/hzhu_/status/1999930478946820539"">Hongcheng Zhu</a>, a developer, offered a more measured assessment: &quot;To top an AI eval, you will most likely need model federation, like what Zoom did. An analogy is that every Kaggle competitor knows you have to ensemble models to win a contest.&quot;</p><p>The comparison to <a href=""https://www.kaggle.com/"">Kaggle</a> — the competitive data science platform where combining multiple models is standard practice among winning teams — reframes Zoom&#x27;s approach as industry best practice rather than sleight of hand. Academic research has long established that ensemble methods routinely outperform individual models.</p><p>Still, the debate exposed a fault line in how the industry understands progress. <a href=""https://x.com/AIMachineDream"">Ryan Pream</a>, founder of Exoria AI, was dismissive: &quot;Zoom are just creating a harness around another LLM and reporting that. It is just noise.&quot; Another commenter captured the sheer unexpectedness of the news: &quot;That the video conferencing app ZOOM developed a SOTA model that achieved 48% HLE was not on my bingo card.&quot;</p><p>Perhaps the most pointed critique concerned priorities. Rumpf argued that Zoom could have directed its resources toward problems its customers actually face. &quot;Retrieval over call transcripts is not &#x27;solved&#x27; by SOTA LLMs,&quot; he wrote. &quot;I figure Zoom&#x27;s users would care about this much more than HLE.&quot;</p><h2><b>The Microsoft veteran betting his reputation on a different kind of AI</b></h2><p>If Zoom&#x27;s benchmark result seemed to come from nowhere, its chief technology officer did not.</p><p>Xuedong Huang <a href=""https://venturebeat.com/ai/inside-zooms-ai-evolution-from-basic-meeting-tools-to-agentic-productivity-platform-powered-by-llms-and-slms"">joined Zoom from Microsoft</a>, where he spent decades building the company&#x27;s AI capabilities. He founded Microsoft&#x27;s speech technology group in 1993 and led teams that achieved what the company described as human parity in speech recognition, machine translation, natural language understanding, and computer vision.</p><p>Huang holds a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from the University of Edinburgh. He is an elected member of the <a href=""https://www.nae.edu/"">National Academy of Engineering</a> and the <a href=""https://www.amacad.org/person/xuedong-huang"">American Academy of Arts and Sciences</a>, as well as a fellow of both the <a href=""https://www.ieee.org/"">IEEE</a> and the <a href=""https://www.acm.org/"">ACM</a>. His credentials place him among the most accomplished AI executives in the industry.</p><p>His presence at Zoom signals that the company&#x27;s AI ambitions are serious, even if its methods differ from the research laboratories that dominate headlines. In his tweet celebrating the benchmark result, Huang framed the achievement as validation of Zoom&#x27;s strategy: &quot;We have unlocked stronger capabilities in exploration, reasoning, and multi-model collaboration, surpassing the performance limits of any single model.&quot;</p><p>That final clause — &quot;surpassing the performance limits of any single model&quot; — may be the most significant. Huang is not claiming Zoom built a better model. He is claiming Zoom built a better system for using models.</p><h2><b>Inside the test designed to stump the world&#x27;s smartest machines</b></h2><p>The benchmark at the center of this controversy, <a href=""https://agi.safe.ai/"">Humanity&#x27;s Last Exam</a>, was designed to be exceptionally difficult. Unlike earlier tests that AI systems learned to game through pattern matching, HLE presents problems that require genuine understanding, multi-step reasoning, and the synthesis of information across complex domains.</p><p>The exam draws on questions from experts around the world, spanning fields from advanced mathematics to philosophy to specialized scientific knowledge. A score of 48.1 percent might sound unimpressive to anyone accustomed to school grading curves, but in the context of HLE, it represents the current ceiling of machine performance.</p><p>&quot;This benchmark was developed by subject-matter experts globally and has become a crucial metric for measuring AI&#x27;s progress toward human-level performance on challenging intellectual tasks,&quot; <a href=""https://www.zoom.com/en/blog/federated-ai-approach-best-quality-for-most-popular-features/"">Zoom’s announcement noted</a>.</p><p>The company&#x27;s improvement of 2.3 percentage points over Google&#x27;s previous best may appear modest in isolation. But in competitive benchmarking, where gains often come in fractions of a percent, such a jump commands attention.</p><h2><b>What Zoom&#x27;s approach reveals about the future of enterprise AI</b></h2><p>Zoom&#x27;s approach carries implications that extend well beyond benchmark leaderboards. The company is signaling a vision for enterprise AI that differs fundamentally from the model-centric strategies pursued by <a href=""https://openai.com/"">OpenAI</a>, <a href=""https://www.anthropic.com/"">Anthropic</a>, and <a href=""https://www.google.com/"">Google</a>.</p><p>Rather than betting everything on building the single most capable model, Zoom is positioning itself as an orchestration layer — a company that can integrate the best capabilities from multiple providers and deliver them through products that businesses already use every day.</p><p>This strategy hedges against a critical uncertainty in the AI market: no one knows which model will be best next month, let alone next year. By building infrastructure that can swap between providers, Zoom avoids vendor lock-in while theoretically offering customers the best available AI for any given task.</p><p>The announcement of <a href=""https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-2/"">OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-5.2</a> the following day underscored this dynamic. OpenAI&#x27;s own communications named Zoom as a partner that had evaluated the new model&#x27;s performance &quot;across their AI workloads and saw measurable gains across the board.&quot; Zoom, in other words, is both a customer of the frontier labs and now a competitor on their benchmarks — using their own technology.</p><p>This arrangement may prove sustainable. The major model providers have every incentive to sell API access widely, even to companies that might aggregate their outputs. The more interesting question is whether Zoom&#x27;s orchestration capabilities constitute genuine intellectual property or merely sophisticated prompt engineering that others could replicate.</p><h2><b>The real test arrives when Zoom&#x27;s 300 million users start asking questions</b></h2><p>Zoom titled its announcement section on industry relations &quot;<a href=""https://www.zoom.com/en/blog/humanitys-last-exam-zoom-ai-breakthrough/"">A Collaborative Future</a>,&quot; and Huang struck notes of gratitude throughout. &quot;The future of AI is collaborative, not competitive,&quot; he wrote. &quot;By combining the best innovations from across the industry with our own research breakthroughs, we create solutions that are greater than the sum of their parts.&quot;</p><p>This framing positions Zoom as a beneficent integrator, bringing together the industry&#x27;s best work for the benefit of enterprise customers. Critics see something else: a company claiming the prestige of an AI laboratory without doing the foundational research that earns it.</p><p>The debate will likely be settled not by leaderboards but by products. When <a href=""https://news.zoom.com/zoom-launches-ai-companion-3-0/"">AI Companion 3.0 </a>reaches Zoom&#x27;s hundreds of millions of users in the coming months, they will render their own verdict — not on benchmarks they have never heard of, but on whether the meeting summary actually captured what mattered, whether the action items made sense, whether the AI saved them time or wasted it.</p><p>In the end, Zoom&#x27;s most provocative claim may not be that it topped a benchmark. It may be the implicit argument that in the age of AI, the best model is not the one you build — it&#x27;s the one you know how to use.</p>",VentureBeat,TECH
