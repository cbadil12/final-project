# 📈 BTC Predictor – Frontend (Streamlit)

Note: This README documents only the frontend of the group project. The Streamlit app is the user-facing layer that visualizes outputs produced by the project pipeline (CSV files). It does not train models and does not call external APIs.

## 🎯 Dashboard Goal

This dashboard provides a fast, readable view of the current BTC market context by combining price movement and news-based sentiment into a simple decision-oriented signal:

- 📊 BTC price view (auto candlesticks when OHLC exists, otherwise a line chart)
- 📰 News feed filtered by time window and relevance
- 💬 Aggregated sentiment (lightweight keyword-based fallback for MVP)
- 🚦 Final signal (UP / DOWN / NEUTRAL) with a confidence-style indicator

---

## 🧩 How the Frontend is Organized

The frontend is built around a single Streamlit dashboard that reads pipeline-generated CSVs and renders them into charts and panels. Data handling and chart logic are kept separate so the UI stays clean and easy to extend.

- Dashboard entry point: Streamlit app that orchestrates the UI and user interactions
- Data utilities: CSV loading + minimal processing (time filtering, optional relevance filter, auto-OHLC when possible)
- Reusable charts: small Altair chart builders (candlesticks, area + line + MA, etc.)
- Data source: CSVs generated by the team pipeline (stored under data/raw/)

---

## 🚀 Running the Dashboard

1. Install dependencies:

 ```pip install -r requirements.txt ```

2. Make sure these pipeline outputs exist:

- data/raw/prices_raw.csv
- data/raw/news_raw.csv

3. Run Streamlit:

 ```streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py ```

If you’re using GitHub Codespaces: open port 8501 from the Ports tab.

## 📊 Expected Data (CSV Contracts)

**Prices (prices_raw.csv)**

Minimum expected columns:

- timestamp
- price

Optional (recommended) OHLC columns:

- open, high, low, close

Auto-candlestick behavior:

- If OHLC columns exist → candlesticks render directly
- If OHLC columns do not exist → the app attempts to compute OHLC by resampling **only if there are enough price points per interval**
- Otherwise → the dashboard falls back to a line chart (still valid for close-only data)

**News (news_raw.csv)**

Minimum expected columns:

- published_at
- title
- description
- source
- axis (*optional metadata; not selected by the user*)

The dashboard can apply a lightweight relevance filter (e.g., matching **bitcoin / btc**) to reduce off-topic items for the BTC view.

## 🧠 Signal Logic (MVP)

For the MVP, sentiment is computed using positive/negative keyword hits and normalized into a simple score:

- 🟢 Positive → higher probability of UP
- 🔴 Negative → higher probability of DOWN
- ⚪ Neutral → mixed/uncertain

The final output is displayed as:

- A clear label (UP / DOWN / NEUTRAL)
- A confidence-style bar
- Consistent color coding
